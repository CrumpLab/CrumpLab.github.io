  abstract = {An examination of eugenic thinking past and present, from forced sterilization to prenatal screening, drawing on experience with those who survived ~eugenics.
                Part science and part social movement, eugenics emerged in the late nineteenth century as a tool for human improvement. In response to perceived threats of criminality, moral degeneration, feeble-mindedness, and “the rising tide of color,” eugenic laws and social policies aimed to better the human race by regulating reproductive choice through science and technology. In this book, Rob Wilson examines eugenic thought and practice—from forced sterilization to prenatal screening—drawing on his experience working with eugenics survivors.~ Using the social sciences' standpoint theory as a framework to understand the intersection of eugenics, disability, social inclusiveness, and human variation, Wilson focuses on those who have lived through a eugenic past and those confronted by the legacy of eugenic thinking today.~ By doing so, he brings eugenics from the distant past to the ongoing present.~Wilson discusses such topics as the conceptualization of eugenic traits; the formulation of laws regulating immigration and marriage and requiring sexual sterilization; the depiction of the targets of eugenics as “subhuman”; ~the systematic construction of a concept of normality; the eugenic logic in prenatal screening and contemporary bioethics; and the incorporation of eugenics and disability into standpoint theory.~Individual purchasers of this book will receive free access to the documentary~Surviving Eugenics, available at EugenicsArchive.ca/film.},

  abstract = {Since its inception Western academic psychology has been influenced by and closely affiliated with eugenics, defined by its originators as the “science of racial betterment.” The role of eugenics has been minimally acknowledged in historical accounts of Western psychology, although it was fundamental to the establishment of empirical psychology methods as well as its applied theories, specifically behaviorism. The continued influence of eugenics in Western psychology, noted in this article, is traced to biologizing human differences while minimizing the role of social context as well as to dividing individuals into groups according to their supposedly innate fitness levels (such as intelligence and optimism). The impact of eugenics on the practice of psychotherapy is highlighted.},

The concept of race has been at the center of both triumphs and tragedies in American history and has had a profound effect on the human experience. Race Unmasked revisits the origins of commonly held beliefs about the scientific nature of racial differences, examines the roots of the modern idea of race, and explains why race continues to generate controversy as a tool of classification even in our genomic age.Surveying the work of some of the twentieth century's most notable scientists, Race Unmasked reveals how genetics and related biological disciplines formed and preserved ideas of race and, at times, racism. A gripping history of science and scientists, Race Unmasked elucidates the limitations of a racial worldview and throws the contours of our current and evolving understanding of human diversity into sharp relief.},

  abstract = {The author presents facts and principles of the basic sciences of man and especially of psychology with an emphasis upon the nature, causation, and modification of abilities and needs. Part I consisting of 15 chapters is more technical than Part II and deals with abilities, the nature and measurement of wants, mental dynamics, individual differences, the interaction of genes and environments, conflicts of wants, conscience, judgments about values, and facts concerning the possibility and desirability of a natural science of values with reference to its problems, methods, and results. In the final chapter of this section, entitled "Living by Science," the author answers the critics of the aims and methods of science contending that science neither destroys nor conflicts with the freedom, purposes, and imagination of the human race. In 23 chapters comprising Part II the author proceeds to discuss the science of philanthropy and the ways and means of improving the welfare of the present and future generations, natural resources and capital, labor and management, buying and selling, money and credit, ownership, human relations, the function, criteria and operations of good government, and the role of law in its effect upon human nature. The final chapter summarizes the author's social philosophy and a program for the betterment of humanity. The first part concerns "getting better men, providing them with better training, and arranging for the best of them to have more power" while the second is concerned with improving the environment of institutions and customs. Six appendices supplement the text. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Its basic premise was that scientific knowledge could harness racial or civilizational ‘‘evolution’’ and turn it into ‘‘development’’. This article examines that project, the conceptual apparatus that the JRD ’s writers and editors brought to bear on it, and how racial ideas informed their conceptions of development and progressive social change through elite scientific and political intervention. Central to this project was an organic notion of ‘‘civilization’’ in which ‘‘nature’’ and ‘‘culture’’ did not so much overlap as flow seamlessly one into the other.},

Racialist eugenics was essential to their multi-layered evolution constructs, as were key religious ideas particular to Protestant modernism.},

Exploring such topics as photographs, exhibitions and advertising the editors suggest that 'modernity' rather than 'modernism' is a valuable way of understanding the changes particular to the visual culture of the time, and they investigate a variety of nineteenth-century images, technologies and visual experiences. With three specially-written essays about definitions of visual culture as an object of study, the book examines genealogies and introduces key writings about culture from writers living in the nineteenth century itself or from those who scrutinized its visual culture from early in the twentieth century such as Walter Benjamin and Siegfried Kracauer. The Nineteenth Century Visual Culture Reader is organized around key themes: * technologies of vision * practices of display and the circulation of images * cities and the built environment * visual representations of the past\# * visual representations of catagories of racial, sexual and social differences * spatial configurations of inside and out, private and public. Selections include well-known authors and new research by younger scholars to produce a well-balanced and comprehensive collection.},

  abstract = {This article presents a history of the early electroencephalography (EEG) of psychopathy, delinquency, and immorality in Great Britain and the United States in the 1940s and 1950s. Then, EEG was a novel research tool that promised ground-breaking insights in psychiatry and criminology. Experts explored its potential regarding the diagnosis, classification, etiology, and treatment of unethical and unlawful persons. This line of research yielded tentative and inconsistent findings, which the experts attributed to methodological and theoretical shortcomings. Accordingly, the scientific community discussed the reliability, validity, and utility of EEG, and launched initiatives to calibrate and standardize the novel tool. The analysis shows that knowledge production, gauging of the research tool, and attempts to establish credibility for EEG in the study of immoral persons occurred simultaneously. The paper concludes with a reflection on the similarities between EEG and neuroimaging—the prime research tool in the current neuroscience of morality—and calls for a critical assessment of their potentials and limitations in the study of immorality and crime.},

  abstract = {President G. Stanley Hall hung only a portrait of Ralph Waldo Emerson in his office at Clark University in Worcester, Massachusetts. The philosopher embodied Hall's most cherished mid-nineteenth century ideas that comprised part of his intellectual worldview. In the 1840s, Emerson reflected on his transcendental concepts of the common mind and instinct, which held all innate human knowledge and behavioral patterns, in his
              Essays:
              
                There is one mind common to all individual men. Every man is an inlet to the same and to all of the same…. In every man's mind, some images, words, and facts remain, without effort on his part to imprint them, which others forget, and afterwards these illustrate to him important laws. All our progress is an unfolding, like the vegetable bud. You have first an instinct, then an opinion, then a knowledge, as the plant has a root, bud, and fruit. Trust the instinct to the end, though you can render no reason.},
