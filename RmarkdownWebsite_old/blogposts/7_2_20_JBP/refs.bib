Black psychologists grounded in a Black/African psychology tradition have long challenged the hegemonic paradigms and racist beliefs perpetuated by Eurocentric approaches to psychology. However, in the absence of teaching about the important contributions of Black/African psychology, many individuals remain unaware of its historical and contemporary impact on the discipline of psychology. Using the three methodological approaches of deconstruction, reconstruction, and construction as a framework, the authors identify the many ways in which Black/African psychology has challenged prevailing beliefs in psychology about Black behavior and culture and forever changed psychological research on Black people.},

The continued influence of eugenics in Western psychology, noted in this article, is traced to biologizing human differences while minimizing the role of social context as well as to dividing individuals into groups according to their supposedly innate fitness levels (such as intelligence and optimism). The impact of eugenics on the practice of psychotherapy is highlighted.},

Therefore, informed consent is a myth in the context of confinement in prison.

Sixty low-income Black seventh- graders were given the Kilpatrick-Cantril scale, which assesses present and future status. The results indicate that, regardless of academic status, males possess higher expectations than females. The expectations of the AU females were the lowest of all the subjects.

Results indicated no linear relationships between racial group concepts and general or specific self-esteem, but more complex relationships were found.

The racist exploitation of Black actors and actresses involved in the production of these films, combined with the derogatory effect of these movies on the Black populace, provides the genesis of the word "blaxploitation." Being the result of Hollywood's quest to improve profits in the late 1960's, these films substituted the positive images associated with the Black liberation movement for the images of violence, degeneracy, and es capism that characterized the themes of these movies.Acting as researchers as well as subjects, the stu dents involved with the project found that the themes of these movies either glorified the lumpen elements of the Black community or put forth fantastically unrealistic solutions to genuine problems. They found that the films attracted millions of Blacks to the theatre and resulted in detrimental effects on the psychology of the entire Black community, the moral training in the Black family, the religious values of Black people, and the educational aspirations of Black youth.},

The general objective of the research is to provide a psychocultural analysis of toys as material objects instrumental in attitude formation and value transmission. To assess the meaning and labeling function of racial play objects as socialization tools, the method of content analysis is used. Department store catalogs and selected historical volumes on toys consti tute the data bases.This study transcends limited ethnic identification and racial preference attitude experiments that have employed dolls as stimuli. It concentrates instead on toys as the focus of analysis, and on their use as communi cators of racial stereotypes. Five categories of com munication bias are used to ascertain stereotypes as well as propaganda content. The data show that racial games and toys have functioned for decades as disseminators of racially biased images. The results of the examination provide a framework for evaluating the content of con temporary media portrayals of African American males.},
