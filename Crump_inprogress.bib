  title = {The Negative Contingency Illusion: A Cognitive Bias Leading to Misjudgement of Protection},
  abstract = {Humans possess a highly adaptive ability to draw inferences about the world by recognizing meaningful links between stimuli and events: making contingency judgements. We describe a systematic bias in contingency judgements that we label the negative contingency illusion in which individuals falsely judge a cue to be protective against an outcome. We demonstrate that the illusion arises when outcome probability is low and occurs when there is no actual relationship between cue and outcome and even when there is a modest positive relationship between cue and outcome. Such misjudgements may lead individuals to superstitious beliefs and could have major public health implications if they lead to the belief in and promotion of treatments that are ineffective or deleterious to the prevention and treatment of illness.},

  title = {Teaching undergraduate students to read empirical articles: An evaluation and revision of the QALMRI method},
  abstract = {Reading and comprehending empirical articles are important skills for students to develop, yet many students struggle to identify and connect the essential information from empirical articles. Here we describe and evaluate a scaffolded approach for teaching undergraduate students to read empirical articles called the QALMRI method. The QALMRI is a generalizable instructional tool for teaching students to identify the key conceptual information necessary for the comprehension and critical evaluation of empirical articles. We had students in a first-year introductory course and students ina third-year research methods course read empirical articles and complete QALMRI outlines throughout the semester. We found that students very quickly learned to use the QALMRI outline in both upper and lower course levels, with performance corresponding to traditional written summaries. However, we also found that students consistently performed poorly on some items, prompting an update and revision to the QALMRI method to address these limitations.},
