  title = {Contextual recruitment of selective attention can be updated via changes in task-relevance},
  abstract = {Evidence across a wide variety of attention paradigms shows that environmental cues can trigger adjustments to ongoing priorities for attending to relevant and irrelevant information. This context-specific control over attention suggests that cognitive control can be both automatic and flexible. For instance, in selective attention tasks, congruency effects are larger for items that appear in a context associated with infrequent conflict than in a context associated with frequent conflict. Since the to-be-presented context cannot be predicted or prepared for in advance, attention is assumed to be rapidly updated on-the-fly, triggered by the currently presented context. Context-specific control exemplifies how learning and memory processes can influence attention to enable cognitive flexibility. However, what determines the use of previously learned associations still remains unclear. In the current study, we examined whether task-relevance would influence the learning and use of context cues in a flanker task. Using a secondary counting task, context dimensions associated with differing levels of conflict were made task-relevant or-irrelevant across the experiment. In short, we found that making new contextual information task-relevant caused participants to ignore a previously learned context-attention association and adopt a new context-specific control strategy; all without changing the experimental stimuli. This result suggests that task-relevance is a key determinant of context-specific control.},

  title = {Production without Rules: Using an Instance Memory Model to Exploit Structure in Natural Language},
  abstract = {Recent research in the artificial grammar learning has shown that a simple instance model of memory can account for a wide variety of artificial grammar results (Jamieson & Mewhort, 2009, 2010, 2011), indicating that language processing may have more in common with episodic memory than previously thought. These results have been used to develop new instance models of natural language processing, including a model of sentence comprehension (Johns & Jones, 2015) and semantic memory (Jamieson, Avery, Johns, & Jones, 2018). The foundations of the models lie in the storage and retrieval of episodic traces of linguistic experience. The current research extends the idea to account for natural language sentence production. We show that the structure of language itself provides sufficient information to generate syntactically correct sentences, even with no higher-level information (such as knowledge of a grammar) available to the model. This work provides insight into the highly structured nature of natural language, and how instance memory models can be a powerful model type to exploit this structure. Additionally, it demonstrates the utility of using the formalisms developed in episodic memory research to understand performance in other domains, such as in language processing.},

  title = {Talking while typing (Title in progress)},
  abstract = {People have the ability to construct ideas and optionally turn them into actions. For example, people can think about an idea, and then decide whether to say the idea out loud in the form of a sentence. The control procesess responsible for translating ideas into action in language production are not fully understood. In particular, we suggest that multi-threading abilities are one aspect of the translation process that is not well understood. We borrow the term mult-threading from computing, where it refers to the ability of a central processing unit to make use of a common code at one level, to control the output of different threads at other levels. An example of multi-threading in language production is the ability to produce language in different formats, such as speaking out loud, or writing or typing. We investigate the general idea that common word-level linguistic codes used for speech act as inputs to control manual keystroke during typing.},

  title = {Sharing and organizing research products as R packages},
  abstract = {A consensus on the importance of open data and reproducible code is emerging. How should data and code be shared to maximize the key desiderata of reproducibility, permanence, and accessibility? Research assets should be stored persistently in formats that are not software restrictive, and documented so that others can reproduce and extend the required computations. The sharing method should be easy to adopt by already busy researchers. We suggest the R package standard as a solution for creating, curating, and communicating research assets. The R package standard, with extensions discussed herein, provides a format for assets and metadata that satisfies the above desiderata, facilitates reproducibility, open access, and sharing of materials through online platforms like GitHub and Open Science Framework. We discuss a stack of R resources that help users create reproducible collections of research assets, from experiments to manuscripts, in the RStudio interface. We created an R package, vertical, to help researchers incorporate these tools into their workflows, and discuss its functionality at length in an online supplement. Together, these tools may increase the reproducibility and openness of psychological science.},
