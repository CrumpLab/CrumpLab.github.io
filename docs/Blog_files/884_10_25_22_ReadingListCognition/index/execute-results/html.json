The project currently includes a textbook, course website, slides, and assignment suggestions under a creative commons license (CC-BY-SA 4.0). The textbook has nine chapters, and at some point I plan to add a few more. As it stands, when I teach this course, we transition from textbook readings toward reading primary research articles. To supplement and encourage more reading of primary research, I'm considering adding a suggested reading list section to the textbook. The purpose of this blog post is to draft some reading lists, and think about how I would curate and present them.\n\nI think I have two general problems to solve:\n\n1.  Picking articles to go on the list (and considering why these/not those).\n2.  Maintaining and publishing the list with preferred software tools, like zotero and quarto.\n\nIdeally, I think I want a zotero folder with sub-folders for different topics in cognition, each full of recommended papers to read. I already use zotero, and it can generate .bib files for each folder, which I can pipe into quarto and print out somewhere. There's wrinkles though.\n\n\\-\\--\nnocite: \\|\n\\@\\*\n\\-\\--\n\n## References\n",
