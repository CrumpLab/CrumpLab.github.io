The project currently includes a textbook, course website, slides, and assignment suggestions under a creative commons license (CC-BY-SA 4.0). The textbook has nine chapters, and at some point I plan to add a few more. As it stands, when I teach this course, we transition from textbook readings toward reading primary research articles. To supplement and encourage more reading of primary research, I'm considering adding a suggested reading list section to the textbook. The purpose of this blog post is to draft some reading lists, and think about how I would curate and present them.\n\nI think I have two general problems to solve:\n\n1.  Picking articles to go on the list (and considering why these/not those).\n2.  Maintaining and publishing the list with preferred software tools, like zotero and quarto.\n\nIdeally, I think I want a zotero folder with sub-folders for different topics in cognition, each full of recommended papers to read. I already use zotero, and it can generate .bib files for each folder, which I can pipe into quarto and print out somewhere. There's wrinkles though.\n\nLet me count the ways. Let's say I have 10-25 recommended articles per chapter. I could put them all in a single .bib file, and then use \\[nocite\\](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/footnotes-and-citations.html#including-uncited-items) to print them all to a reference list at the end of a chapter. This will be a long undifferentiated reference list in alphabetical order. I could probably sort it differently with CSL.\n\nI remembered that I already started an \"additional reading\" section in the Eugenics and Psychology chapter. I don't like how it is presently formatted on the page, but I do like that it appears as a section in the chapter. Hmmm.\n\nRevisiting that chapter I see that I tried two things. First, I wrote a code chunk to automatically generate a reading list from selected .bib entries in a .bib file. But, I guess I didn't like how that worked out, because I ended up typing out the references directly.\n\nHere's a version of the code chunk:\n\n\n::: {.cell messages='false'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(dplyr)\nload_bib <- bib2df::bib2df(file=\"memory_timeline.bib\")\n\nselected_bib <- load_bib %>%\n  filter(BIBTEXKEY %in% c(\n    \"atkinsonHumanMemoryProposed1968\",\n    \"baddeleyWorkingMemory1974\",\n    \"craikLevelsProcessingFramework1972\"))\n\nbib2df::df2bib(selected_bib,file = \"temp.bib\")\n\nstevemisc::print_refs(\"temp.bib\",csl=\"apa-annotated-bibliography.csl\")\n```\n\nAtkinson, R.
