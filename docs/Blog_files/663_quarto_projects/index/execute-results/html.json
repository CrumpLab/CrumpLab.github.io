I ❤️ Quarto.\n\nThis morning I'm about to start another project, and TBH I'm procrastinating a little bit. I don't have writer's block. I know that as soon as I get the project started I'll rattling off for the rest of the day, week, or however long. I have mild getting-started-with-a-new-project-block.\n\nOne of the things that drew me into Rstats, R Markdown, and now Quarto in the first place was the ability to collect nearly all of the research assets that I typically assemble in one place and to make most of them computationally reproducible, at least to a reasonable standard for my field. For example, a typical project might have some data or simulated data from a model, scripts to analyse the data, maybe some custom functions for the project, a research paper, maybe a slide deck or poster. All of these things can be housed in a Quarto project, and Quarto can handle most of the different outputs as well. It's also pretty easy to put all of these things into a Quarto website and share everything on GitHub.\n\nBefore Quarto, my colleague Matti Vuorre and I wrote a paper for psychologists to consider using R Markdown and other R-centric tools to create and share reproducible research projects [@vuorre2021]. We called that approach [Vertical](https://crumplab.com/vertical/). Now, I'm mostly using Quarto to accomplish the same goals.\n\nSome quick examples of Quarto projects:\n\n-   This blog\n-   my lab webpage: <https://crumplab.com>\n-   Course websites: <https://crumplab.com/cognition>\n-   OER textbooks: <https://crumplab.com/cognition/textbook>\n\nOverall, these are quick to set up using templates provided by RStudio. So, what's my issue?\n\nLike I said I'm procrastinating. What I should do is open RStudio, create a new Quarto website project, and then get on with life. The website won't look quite right, and I'll have to modify the `_Quarto.yml` file. I won't be able to remember what I need to modify so I'll look at previous examples and scrape something together. It will take probably all of 15 minutes for me to do this.\n\nIt would be nice if my previous self had set up templates that make it even easier and faster for me to get started. Part of the reason for this post was to consider whether I should make those templates right now.\n\nPros:\n\n-   I would have a template, which hypothetically makes it faster for me to start up a new project\n\nCons:\n\n-   There already is a decent starting template; not all projects are the same, and I'll probably end up modifying any template I make, so why not just start with the RStudio one.\n\nMaybe I need to go through the process like I normally do, and keep notes on things that I might put in a template. Or, at least think about it.\n\n## Making of a Quarto project\n\nThe flavor of this project is computational modeling. Ideally, I would share the scripts and analysis, and some kind of global write-up, perhaps some slides.\n\n-   [x] make a new RStudio Quarto website project.\n\nThis is the vanilla Quarto website project.\n\n![](images/Screenshot%202023-06-27%20at%2010.28.58%20AM.png)\n\nThis is the default yml that controls the website build:\n\n``` default\nproject:\n  type: website\n\nwebsite:\n  title: \"GPTAttentionPerformance\"\n  navbar:\n    left:\n      - href: index.qmd\n        text: Home\n      - about.qmd\n\nformat:\n  html:\n    theme: cosmo\n    css: styles.css\n    toc: true\n```\n\nThings I usually change later:\n\n-   [x] specify a port number for website preview so that it doesn't randomly change every time\n\n-   [x] make a folder for putting things that don't get compiled\n\n-   [x] change output directory to docs for github pages\n\n-   [x] change style to minty\n\n-   [x] scrap the about page because I tend to put that info on the front page.\n\n-   [x] add description, repo-url and site url\n\nOne issue is how to translate the documents in the project to pages on the website. This can be rearranged at any time using the `_quarto.yml` file, which defines website navigation and connects individual .qmd files to the navbar at the top or on the side. For example, the two pages in the default project are given links \"home\" and \"about\" at the top of the website.\n\nIn some previous projects I use a flexible starting position in terms of website structure. Quarto will automatically build sidebar links for .qmd documents. I think I'll add that here as a starting point.\n\nSomething like this. Need to consider ways to template this for later. For now, I can copy and paste from here.\n\n``` default\nproject:\n  type: website\n  output-dir: docs\n  preview:\n    port: 4200\n    browser: true\n    navigate: true\n\nwebsite:\n  title: \"GPTAttentionPerformance\"\n  description: \"A computational modeling project examining whether or not a GPT model can simulate human performance in classic attention and performance tasks.\"\n  repo-url: https://github.com/CrumpLab/GPTAttentionPerformance\n  repo-actions: [source, edit, issue]\n  site-url: \"https://crumplab.com/GPTAttentionPerformance\"\n  search: true\n  navbar:\n    left:\n      - href: index.qmd\n        text: Home\n    - icon: github\n        href: https://github.com/CrumpLab/GPTAttentionPerformance\n        aria-label: GitHub\n  sidebar:\n    - title: \"Home\"\n      style: \"floating\"\n      collapse-level: 3\n      align: left\n      contents: auto\n\nformat:\n  html:\n    theme: minty\n    css: styles.css\n    toc: true\n```\n\nThe landing page, defined in `index.qmd`, might start out like this:\n\n``` default\n---\ntitle: \"Simulating Attention and Performance tasks with an LLM\"\nauthor:\n  - name: Matthew J. C. Crump\n    orcid: 0000-0002-5612-0090\n    email: mcrump@brooklyn.cuny.edu\n    affiliations:\n      - name: Brooklyn College of CUNY\ndescription: \"A computational modeling project examining whether or not a GPT model can simulate human performance in classic attention and performance tasks.\"\ndate: 6-27-2023\ntitle-block-style: default\n---\n\n## Project Information\n\nBrief notes on the project\n\n## Repository Information\n\nBrief notes about the repo\n```\n\nThe next step is to make new folders and add .qmds to them. I made a `modeling` folder, and added a .qmd that will act as a scratchpad/to-do list for me. Now any page in the modeling folder will automatically show up in the left-side navigation.\n\n![](images/Screenshot%202023-06-27%20at%2011.29.30%20AM.png)\n\nThis is good enough for now. I'm going to pass on making templates. I think I'm still in the stage of figuring out what I want by making projects from scratch. Hopefully I will really like one of these project structures, and then I can make a template out of it later.\n\nTime to get going on this actual project!\n",
