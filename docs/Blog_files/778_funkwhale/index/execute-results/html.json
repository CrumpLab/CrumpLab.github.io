Audience: notes to self\n\nI love music: listening to it and making it. I've had increasingly less time for music, and am trying to find more time for it. So, as a part of learning mastodon I created an account for my music interests:\n\n[https://bbs.crumplab.com/\\@homophony](https://bbs.crumplab.com/@homophony)\n\nIt's only been a week, but I'm having lots of fun connecting with music makers on the #fediverse. This could mean more overall music, which would be great!\n\nWhen I first tried mastodon a week ago I had no idea about activitypub, or the broader fediverse. I didn't realize there are many different \"platforms\" compatible or semi-compatible with the [activitypub protocol](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/). This means that user accounts on one platform like mastodon can interact with user accounts on another platform like [pixelfed](https://pixelfed.org) (open-source version of instagram for picture sharing). There a [lots of platforms in the fediverse](https://github.com/emilebosch/awesome-fediverse), including [funkwhale](https://funkwhale.audio) for audio and music sharing.\n\n## Funkwhale notes\n\nUsing this space for note collection on funkwhale.\n\nMain site: <https://funkwhale.audio>\n\nFunkwhale forum: <https://forum.funkwhale.audio>\n\nFunkwhale on mastodon: [https://fosstodon.org/\\@funkwhale](https://fosstodon.org/@funkwhale){.uri}\n\nDashboard of Funkwhale pods <https://network.funkwhale.audio/dashboards/d/overview/funkwhale-network-overview?orgId=1&refresh=2h>\n\nDev and issues: <https://dev.funkwhale.audio/funkwhale>\n\n## Spinning up\n\nInstallation dev instructions <https://docs.funkwhale.audio/installation/>\n\nOther instructions, possibly helpful for a droplet setup.\n\n<https://geek-cookbook.funkypenguin.co.nz/recipes/funkwhale/>\n\nLeaving this for another time...back.\n\n## Start trying\n\nHow long will this take? I was hoping to do this all on digital ocean. Will try develop instructions. Starting at 6:42.\n\nOk, that was super easy.\n\nI created a new Ubuntu droplet on digital ocean. Logged into the terminal by website. I followed these steps from the quick install.\n\n``` bash\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install curl\nsudo sh -c \"$(curl -sSL https://get.funkwhale.audio/)\"\n```\n\nMade an A name to create a new subdomain for my pod. Pressed enter a couple times to say YES during install. Took about 15 minutes, mostly waiting. Now I have a funkwhale pod. huh.\n\nWhat do I do with this?\n\n![](images/Screen%20Shot%202022-11-12%20at%207.27.54%20AM.png)\n\n## musicbrainz\n\n-   downloaded the musicbrainz app\n\n<https://musicbrainz.org/>\n\nMight have to use this for metadata? After making an account over here, I realize this is mostly for tagging .mp3 libraries of existing music so it is easy to upload with tags.\n\nI could add my own artist info here I guess. Not sure how useful it will be yet for adding metadata around individual tracks I create. It could be very useful, or not. Need to learn more about associating new music audio files I make with all the necessary metadata.\n\n## Issue collection\n\nI have destroyed the droplet.\n\n-   Made my admin account \"homophony\", which worked all fine and dandy. However, this meant that I couldn't use that handle to create channels and share under that artist name.\n\n-   musicbrainz is interesting and complicated. I should consider listing exist discography there. It seems to be mostly for uploading digital music collections, which is not what I'm interested in doing. Funkwhale could be altogether more than I need it for. Still...curious.\n\nRestarted the droplet...waiting through the install.\n\nGot messed up with the certbot, needed to change the A name record so my subdomain pointed to the droplet.\n\n## Creating a channel and frustrations\n\nI spent a couple hours getting the pod up and running on digital ocean, and most of that time was me making little mistakes.\n\nAfter I got the pod fully up and running I made sure my admin name was NOT my artist name. Then, I made an artist channel to share some tracks. There is a choice between music channels and podcast channels. I'm not planning to do any podcasting here, but the functionality for that looked good (it may integrate with podcasting services for indexing).\n\nCreating a music channel was easy, and uploading tracks was easy. And, it seemed easy to share the link to the channel so other people could listen to it. I could listen to the tracks, but for a whole day anytime I accessed the funkwhale channel as a \"non-logged in\" user, I got a spinning wheel. I had to allow unauthenticated users access to the api, and that seemed to have worked? I'm testing right now.\n\nLast night I almost gave up on this funkwhale thing, but I might persist just a little bit.\n\nI'm not totally sure what features I'm looking for.\n\n-   Ability to upload tracks and share them in a playlist\n\n-   Ability to get some metrics on listening\n\n-   Comments or notes per track? Not sure how much I want this feature.\n\n## Activitypub?\n\nI can use mastodon to follow my account on funkwhale, and then post to my funkwhale account from mastodon; but, where does the post go? I can't receive on funkwhale?\n\n## Embed playlist audio player\n\nThis part looks fun. I'm placing embed code to see if the playlist shows up here.\n\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"330\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://audio.crumplab.com/front/embed.html?&amp;type=artist&amp;id=1\">\n\n</iframe>\n\nThe embed worked, but this won't work later if I shut down my funkwhale server.\n\n## Castopod\n\nOpen source software for podcasting...useful for a music channel?\n\n<https://code.castopod.org/adaures/castopod>\n\n## Channel stuff\n\nI'm currently manicuring a channel to what happens with that. This is involving using midjourney to make cover art from the track notes I used to describe each piece.\n\nNot sure I will keep with funkwhale, but I like that everything is going into a structured database that I could use later.\n\n## Gitlab\n\n<https://dev.funkwhale.audio/funkwhale/funkwhale/-/issues/1304>\n\n## Learn more\n\nLots of other OSS audio-streaming options, should check those out.\n\n<https://github.com/awesome-selfhosted/awesome-selfhosted#media-streaming---audio-streaming>\n\n## things to read\n\n<https://ins-rt.net/text/sounds-from-the-fediverse-an-introduction-to-funkwhale-a-decentralised-community-audio-platform>\n\n<https://ins-rt.net/text/revaluing-music-in-the-digital-economy-an-interview-with-austin-hou-from-currents>\n\n<https://www.theslowmusicmovement.org/about.html>\n",
