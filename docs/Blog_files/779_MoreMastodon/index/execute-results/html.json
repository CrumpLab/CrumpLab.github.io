Or, I may leave this post open and add to it throughout the day. One thing is for sure, I don't have time to use Adobe Express to make a header for this blog post. Moving forward, I think I would like the option to have some #rstats generative art code do that for me. That way I can rip into the writing faster.\n\nAbout a week ago I tried Mastodon. It feels longer ago. I went from joining an instance, to learning about the fediverse, activitypub, and more, to spinning up my own instance using masto.host. So, crumplab.com got a new subdomain: <https://bbs.crumplab.com>\n\nAs of right now this instance is closed to new accounts. But, it is possible to view the local feed, showing posts made by accounts inside the instance: [bbs.crumplab.com/public](https://bbs.crumplab.com/public). In general, the local feeds of other instances can be viewed in the same way (provided the instance admins approve the option).\n\nWhen I get time to keep my skill set up to date, I dive in, so I'm happy I happened to have a bit of time to get started with the fediverse. I'm pretty sure all of these tools will become useful for my research and teaching, as well as my students. And, I need to become semi-proficient in the toolset before it becomes useable in the lab and classroom, so I got busy learning the ropes of administering a mastodon instance, as well as operating an account. Much more important was observing and listening to the existing communities on mastodon, for tips and conventions for engaging with the fediverse. I'm very happy to meet such a wide array of engaged people who are stewards of the digital community.\n\n## Admin life\n\nI have lots to learn as a mastodon admin, but so far masto.host made the whole operation very easy. I started on a [moon plan](https://masto.host/pricing/) and quickly upgraded to a planet because I can see becoming a longer term user. As I get tooled up, the next step would probably be running the instance on my own server somewhere. The main hassle I'm dealing with as an admin is blocking other instances (see this helpful list if you are looking to block instances: <https://github.com/chaossocial/about/blob/master/blocked_instances.md>)\n\nI did not have time to learn how to use the [mastodon API](https://docs.joinmastodon.org/), which is very-well documented; so, I was unable to automate the process of blocking instances. There is an [older R client for mastodon](https://github.com/ThomasChln/mastodon), and a brand new one in the works called [rtoot](https://github.com/schochastics/rtoot), which is very exciting. I'll wait for that one before attempting to automate admin tasks.\n\n## Multiplicities\n\nIf I'm being honest Multiplicity did not hold up. But, that's OK, I still ❤️ Michael Keaton.\n\n\n::: {.cell .column-margin}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nknitr::include_graphics(\"images/MV5BMTUzNTYxMTUzMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMzgxMTg4._V1_.jpg\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](images/MV5BMTUzNTYxMTUzMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMzgxMTg4._V1_.jpg){width=164}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe whole mastodon switch has been a wonderful prompt for me to personally reflect upon my own social media use. As a part of the reflection, and as an excuse to learn more about Mastodon.\n",
