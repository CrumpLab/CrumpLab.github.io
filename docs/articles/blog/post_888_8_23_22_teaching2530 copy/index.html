<p>I’m using this post to get my words flowing in preparation for
another semester at Brooklyn College of CUNY. My research area is
cognition; however, over the past decade I have mostly not taught
cognition courses, especially at the undergraduate level where I taught
lots of stats and research methods. Last year was the first time I got
to teach an intro to cognition course two semesters in a row! Looks like
I’m on a roll because I get to teach it again this semester.
Additionally, I’m teaching cognition modules for separate doctoral and
masters programs, so Fall 2022 is a whole lotta cognition going on.</p>
<p>TLDR: I’m going to try ungrading my course this semester. Should be
fun.</p>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="mood">Mood<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#mood"></a>
</h2>
<p>I’m mostly done with course prep. The semester starts in two days.
I’m eagerly avoiding the last bits and pieces of my syllabi, hence this
post. I’m excited for what I expect will be an interesting and rewarding
semester. At the same time I am still floating in mood. I need some mood
extraction. What is my mood?</p>
<p>Instead of explicating the mood, I will point at major mood
influences. I’m hoping to summon their power and redirect the energy
into a Megazord like the Power Rangers would do when they confront
issues of the day. The major mood influencers are eugenics and the
white-washing of psychology, academic integrity, and ungrading.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="eugenics-and-the-white-washing-of-psychology">Eugenics and the white-washing of psychology<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#eugenics-and-the-white-washing-of-psychology"></a>
</h2>
<p>I started learning more about the social, historical, and political
aspects of psychology that were not incorporated into the curriculum
that I was trained on. Past me didn’t realize how much of psychology was
deeply rooted in eugenics and related systems of oppression. IMO, many
of the roots remain buried and not widely discussed in psychology
curricula. Sadly, some of the roots are still around. Learning about
eugenics/psychology connections has impacted both my research and
teaching outlook. In short, when considering how to approach a research
or teaching project I have a voice asking “what would a eugenicist do?”,
and then, just like Meatloaf, “I won’t do that.”</p>
<p>This summer I embarked on a long eugenics and society in general
reading project. <a href="https://crumplab.com/articles/blog/post_990_6_28_22_eugenicsbooks/index.html">My
reading list is here</a>. All of that reading built up a strong
anti-eugenics mood.</p>
<p>Some highlights very much worth the read for psychologists are <span class="citation">Yakushko (2019)</span>, and <span class="citation">Guthrie (2004)</span>. Yakushko’s “Scientific
Pollyannaism” covers a wide range of disappointing and deeply
problematic aspects of early to modern psychology. Guthrie’s “Even the
Rat was white” should have been the default textbook on the history of
psychology since it was first published in 1976.</p>
<p>I have already incorporated aspects of these topics into the content
of my cognition course (e.g., chapters on <a href="https://crumplab.com/cognition/textbook/eugenics-and-psychology.html">eugenics</a>
and <a href="https://crumplab.com/cognition/textbook/intelligence-testing.html">IQ
testing</a>). But, I have not yet really changed the structure of the
course in a way that aims to deconstruct eugenics influences in the
classroom. For example, I’m not interested in churning my students
through testing and ranking processes inspired by eugenicists. I’d
rather participate with my students in a process of engaging in the
course material.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="academic-integrity">Academic integrity<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#academic-integrity"></a>
</h2>
<p>At the end of May I wrote a blog post about some widespread cheating
behavior that occurred in my cognition class in Fall 2021. I wrote that
post as a part of a teaching assessment process and to reflect on how to
do better next time. <a href="https://crumplab.com/cognition/">My
undergrad cognition course</a> is going into its third revision. I first
taught it <em>synchronous</em> online (gave zoom lectures etc.), and
then in Spring 2022 I taught in an <em>asynchronous</em> format
(recorded lots of YouTube videos). A few months ago I also wrote <a href="https://crumplab.com/articles/blog/post_996_5_20_22_assignmentflex/index.html">a
post about how I structured the asynchronous course with a buffet of
assignment options for students</a>, so they had many ways to get a
grade they wanted to achieve. I think the second version of the course
with lots of assignment choice was much better for student engagement,
and fortunately I didn’t have to deal with any academic integrity
issues.</p>
<p>I’m intending to roll over the successes from the second version into
my <em>in-person</em> course this fall, especially all of options for
assignment choice.</p>
<p>I’d also like to avoid major academic integrity issues. One of the
outcomes of having a class where most students violated academic
integrity principles was that I took <a href="https://crumplab.com/articles/blog/post_994_5_26_22_cheating/index.html">a
quick dive into the literature on cheating behavior in university</a>.
If you teach psychology and are interested in whether your students are
cheating or not, I’d recommend reading <span class="citation">Jenkins et
al. (2022)</span> who estimate that about 75% of students self-report
cheating in psych classes. It’s a concern. There’s so many ways to cheat
these days, such as paying someone else (contract cheating) to take your
course for you or do your assignments <span class="citation">(Hollis
2018)</span>. Or, getting an AI like GPT-3 to do your writing
assignments.</p>
<p>I’d like to run a course where students would rather engage in the
material than violate academic integrity issues.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="ungrading">Ungrading<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#ungrading"></a>
</h2>
<p>An inspiring read this summer was an edited book on “Ungrading”,
<span class="citation">Blum (2020)</span>. Each chapter was written by
different educators who discussed their own misgivings with the standard
practice of grading students, and their own ways of practicing
ungrading.</p>
<p>More recently, I thought this tweet nicely captured ungrading:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">
</p>
<p>Grades are inequitable. Ungrading is the set of conversations that
inspect and work to dismantle a system of ranking and crude evaluation
that further marginalizes already marginalized students.</p>

<p>— Jesse Stommel (<span class="citation">(<strong>Jessifer?</strong>)</span>)
<a href="https://twitter.com/Jessifer/status/1558825320488116225?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" class="external-link">August
14, 2022</a></p>
</blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script><p>I haven’t yet tried ungrading in any of my courses, and there are
lots of ways to do so. This semester will involve weaving in some
ungrading practices.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="finish-my-syllabus">Finish my syllabus<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#finish-my-syllabus"></a>
</h2>
<p>If I had to summarize my mood, it is a Megazord composed of the above
influences. I hope this Megazord will bring the energy I need to update
my syllabus for this semester. I’ve been finding ways to put off writing
the final bits and pieces of the syllabus. And, it is clear to me that I
am perilously close to having to do that work, like right now.</p>
<p>My closing thoughts are just me telling myself what I need to do
next.</p>
<p>My syllabus is located <a href="https://crumplab.com/cognition/articles/course_docs/Fall_2022_Psyc_2530_syllabus.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>What do I need to do it?</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Update course details</li>
<li>Update course schedule with Fall 2022 dates</li>
<li>Re-write course assessment and grading parts, make the language
around this as clear and straightforward as possible.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="scratchpad">Scratchpad<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#scratchpad"></a>
</h2>
<p>I’m mostly done with this post for now. It did the thing I needed it
to do, which was to get the words flowing again (summer I miss you). I
spent a bunch of the summer mulling over how I would implement
ungrading, but have not yet made every step explicit to myself by
writing it down. I might use this scratchpad section to try out some
thoughts about ungrading before putting them in the syllabus. Or, maybe
this will just be the end of the post. I plan to report back on how the
ungrading goes.</p>
