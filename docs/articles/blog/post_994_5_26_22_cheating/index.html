<p>In a previous version of this post, I shared a detective/thriller
themed story about academic integrity issues arising in a course I
taught. The story picked up more attention than I anticipated. I shared
the story as part of a course assessment writing exercise, which has now
been completed, and the original post is no longer available.</p>
<p>Part of my course assessment exercise was to learn more about the
literature on cheating behavior. I conducted a short literature review
on that topic and am posting brief notes about a few of the papers.</p>
<p>For teaching psychology, I found this paper to be most relevant and
current:</p>

<p>Laments that there isn’t much empirical work on cheating, and that
most prior work repeatedly demonstrates the same finding: giving
students the opportunity to cheat by allowing them to grade their own
tests (and change their answers) elicits cheating behavior (the

<p>ABSTRACT Forty-five graduate students received three quizzes in one
of their courses, and also filled out the Minnesota Multiphasic
Personality Inventory (MMPI) and a questionnaire on cheating. The main
findings were: (a) the inci dence of cheating among these graduate
subjects was found to be at least as extensive as reported in prior
studies among undergraduate students?at least eighteen of the forty-five
(40%) graduate subjects cheated on the quizzes; (b) pressure to obtain
good grades was the main reason subjects felt they cheated in the past;
(c) there was a lack of consensus whether certain behaviors constitute
cheating; (d) no significant personality differences were found between
cheaters and non-cheaters; (e) the MMPI results provided evidence in
support of the doctrine of specificity of moral behavior.</p>

<p>Abstract</p>
<p>The purpose of this study was to investigate the frequency, methods,
and correlates of college cheating. A questionnnaire measuring 7 subject
variables and 33 specific behaviors was administered to 200 students.
The finding that about 75% of those surveyed had cheated in college was
interpreted as supporting an hypothesized trend toward increasing
dishonesty. Data on approval and guilt, reasons for cheating, reactions
to cheating, and specific techniques were included. It was found that
sex, year in shcool, grade point average, academic major,
fraternity-sorority membership, and extracurricular participation were
significantly related to cheating. The conclusions supported the
importance of traditional explanatory variables and suggested an
interpretation based on attribution theory.</p>

<p>Abstract</p>
<p>This article reviews 1 decade of research on cheating in academic
institutions. This research demonstrates that cheating is prevalent and
that some forms of cheating have increased dramatically in the last 30
years. This research also suggests that although both individual and
contextual factors influence cheating, contextual factors, such as
students’ perceptions of peers’ behavior, are the most powerful
influence. In addition, an institution’s academic integrity programs and
policies, such as honor codes, can have a significant influence on
students’ behavior. Finally, we offer suggestions for managing cheating
from students’ and faculty members’ perspectives.</p>

<p>“I got very excited and signed up for several classes at the
community college. My employer was paying for the online class but I
should have remembered that I would be the one who’d have to take the
classes in the end. I didn’t think about it . . . caused me a panic
attack. . . . I took some of the classes and did some of the projects
but I knew from the beginning that there was no way I could take the
online classes and complete them myself. After having that epiphany, I
realized that I’d be on the hook for part of the course fee if I didn’t
take my online classes and complete them (yes, my employer would only
pay if I passed the class) . . . Anyway, I did a bit of research and
found No Need To Study. Hiring them was the best decision ever! No Need
To Study works lightning fast; it is like they know the classes inside
out, taking my classes in record time. I got my classes done! My
employer paid and I have the certifications now.”</p>

<p>Evaluates neutralization theory approach to academic misconduct.</p>
<p>Neutralization theory posits a five-factor system to explain how
students justify academic misconduct:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Denial of Responsibility</li>
<li>Denial of Injury</li>
<li>Denial of Victim</li>
<li>Condemnation of the Condemner</li>
<li>Appeal to higher loyalties</li>
</ol>
<p>This theory was developed in the context of juvenile delinquency and
often applied to academic misconduct.</p>
<p>Table 1 is reasons for Academic misconduct from a sample of
university students from 6 institutions in Romania.</p>
<p>Factor analysis suggests student reasons have a single dimension, not
five dimensions.</p>
<p>Suggests Achievement Goal Theory as a better model (Urdan, 1997).</p>
