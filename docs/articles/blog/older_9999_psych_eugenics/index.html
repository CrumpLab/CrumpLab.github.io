<p>Note: This is a loose collection of notes I put together around
summer 2020. I have more recently attempted to organize some of this
information across two chapters in my introductory textbook to cognitive
psychology:</p>

<p>I’m working through the task of learning about influences of eugenics
on psychology and society. As a part of this, I’m documenting the
eugenics views held by many psychologists, as well as connections
between psychologists and eugenics. I will keep updating this page as I
document the connections. There are many connections, it will take some
time. So far, this is an emerging disorganized collection of
factoids.</p>
<p>A major overarching goal of compiling and documenting connections
between psychology and eugenics is to better understand how strucutural
eugenics and racism in the discipline of Psychology has shaped and
continues to shape the field, both in terms of the questions it asks,
and who gets to ask them.</p>

<li>from <a href="http://www.cyberus.ca/~pballan/Pillfina.htm" class="external-link">http://www.cyberus.ca/~pballan/Pillfina.htm</a>:
This personal brush with political prejudice did not change Pillsbury’s
official scientific stance on race and mental degeneracy. His Education
as the Psychologist Sees It (1920), for instance, was part of a
successful nationwide postwar marketing campaign advocating the use of
new group “mental testing” techniques in American schools. Here,
Pillsbury uncritically combined past eugenic twin-studies with the new
“Army Alpha and Beta” intelligence testing data. Surprisingly, his
personal conclusion after thirty-three years of teaching is “that one
can never produce intelligence by education, that one must begin much
farther back in actually insuring the birth of intelligent people”
(p. 46). [p. 525] At this time, however, Pillsbury was just one of many
psychologists who accepted such notions (e.g., R. M. Yerkes,
Psychological Examination in the United States Army [1921]; W. S.
Hunter, General Psychology [1919]; R. S. Woodworth, Psychology
[1921]).</li>

War I. He was the chief psychological examiner in three army camps.[2]
During that time he compiled bar graphs with E.S. Jones that showed the
predictive value of group psychological tests.[3] His work persuaded
government officials to continue the testing program, which ultimately
led military officials to order the recording of data on the national
origins of the troops tested.[3] The data collected was used in a way
that Hunter did not approve; combining the psychological test scores
with the location of where the individual grew up supported the notion
of Nordic superiority, which was not his intention.[3]”</li>
<li>Might be worth reading Hunter’s delayed reaction research in animals
and children <span class="citation">(Hunter 1917)</span>. On the hand,
it seems that Yerkes advocated that tests of delayed reaction ability
could distinguish humans from infra-humans. And, on the other hand, the
results were used in the context of debate about mental
representations.</li>

</h3>
<p>I need to pause for a bit. I’ve been quickly trying to sketch out
some connections between APA presidents and eugenics. Mostly this
involves googling their name and eugenics, and pulling the string.</p>
<p>My main aim in making these connections is to draw attention to the
larger pattern of institutional eugenics within the discipline of
Psychology. I am less interested about whether or not specific
individuals were “card-carrying” eugenicists, or really truly held
eugenics views in their “soul” or not. I think it is enough to establish
the pattern and spread of eugenic ideology to consider how eugenics
shaped the discipline. For example, I suspect that rampant eugenics had
a part to play in systemically limiting the diversity of faculty in
Psychology. I suspect it also guided the questions we ask, and continue
to ask.</p>
<p>So, as a part of reflecting on what I am doing, I drew up a quick
spreadsheet of the APP presidents. For the first 50, I gave them each a
eugenics score from 0 to 1, with some intermediate scores representing
eugenics adjacent work. These are just some rough personal qualitative
estimates, to put a number on things. My rough numberization adds up to
34.75 of 50 APA presidents were into eugenics or eugenics adjacent
research. Very few were ever explicitly anti-eugenics.</p>
<p>Consider a sentence like, “It is overwhelming the case that the first
50 years of American Psychology as measured by APA presidents research
interests and leadership demonstrate that the discpline of psychology
was primarily constructed as arm of the national eugenics movement in
the USA”. I just wrote that sentence, and I’m starting to think that I’m
not exaggerating.</p>

<li>“Student-led protests, sometimes violent in nature, against public
appearances by Jensen, Eysenck, and Shockley produced a situation
wherein they perceived a dichotomy between politically blinded critics
and “pure” scholars, who were subject to psychoterror, attempts at
intimidation, and death threats.123 Eysenck, Jensen, and Herrnstein, in
conjunction with ten other American and British academics, suc- ceeded
in initiating a resolution defending them against “personal and
professional disparagement.”124 Here they placed the criticism that they
received for their theory of inheritance in the same tradition as the
persecution of “well-known scientist victims, includ[ing],Galileo, in
orthodox Italy; Darwin, in Victorian England; Einstein, in Hitler’s
Germany; and Mendelian biologists, in Stalin’s Russia.”125 Many of the
attacks against the heredity researchers were seen to be made by “non-
scientists” or “outspoken enemies of a scientific attitude.” Attacks
were also deemed to come from “academics who had determined that any
explanation of differences among humans could be traced to the
environmental theory.” In the light of the widespread “environment
oriented orthodoxy,” there was practically a “witch hunt” against those
who held ideas based on heredity or a wish to develop further research
work in the area of the biological bases of behavior.</li>

<p>Part of the impetus for all of this research is to characterize the
widespread acceptance of eugenics in terms of institutions. So far my
perspective is that psychology as a discipline has a problem with
instutional forms of eugenics and racism. Institutional eugenics is term
that could carry broad meaning from literal institutions (e.g., such as
the APA), to widely adopted policies in society inspired and propagated
by eugenics leaders (e.g., IQ testing).</p>

<p>How have institutions with some involvement in eugenics responded to
their involvement? I’ve been wondering about this question the whole
time that I’ve learning about eugenics. With respect to eugenics I’m
still in the “what happened” phase, and perhaps slowly coming to the
“what happened next” phase, which could lead into the “what’s going on
right now phase”.</p>
<p>In any case. When I have time I will extract this section and make a
post out of it to keep track of info I’m finding. I’ve discovered the
internet archive <a href="https://archive.org" class="external-link uri">https://archive.org</a> contains an ample amount of
historical eugenics literature, so have been collecting some of it. It’s
also interesting to search for indvidual psychologists in this database
because all sorts of old textbooks come up. More recently, I’ve started
coming across government documents, for example the National Research
Council has convened multiple panels to assess the impact of certain
practices on society, some of these include eugenics related
practices.</p>

<h2 id="psychonomics-history">Psychonomics History<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#psychonomics-history"></a>
</h2>
<p>I’m learning about influences of eugenics on psychology and society.
As a part of this, I’m documenting the eugenics views held by many
psychologists, as well as connections between psychologists and
eugenics.</p>
<p>Currently my research is highly disorganized, provisional, and
unfolding across various blog posts. In this post I am interested in
possible connections between eugenics and the Psychonomics Society, of
which I am a member and fellow. I’ve been attending Psychonomics since
the mid 2000s. Until now, I haven’t looked into the history and
formation of Psychonomics. So I’ll do that with an eye out for
eugenics.</p>
<p>Before jumping in I’ll say a few things. First, I’m a 40 year old
recently tenured cognitive psychologist at Brooklyn College of CUNY.
I’ve been around the cognition block in Canada and the US. It never
occured to me, and I was never taught, that there were extraordinarily
deep connections between eugenics and psychology in the US and Canada.
For a quick primer on some of the connections one could read <span class="citation">Yakushko (2019b)</span>. Although, here one might get
the sense that the “pre-history” of psychology (e.g., before 1950s) was
heavily influenced by eugenics, and that part just went away. I’m not so
sure (in general for the discipline).</p>
<p>I’ve been <a href="https://crumplab.github.io/blogposts/7_13_20_PsychEugenics/7_13_20_PsychEugenics.html" class="external-link">slowly
tracing eugenics and psychology connections leading up to the cognitive
revolution</a>, and am about to continue forward past the 1950s. So, a
good place to start is in my own backyard. In other words, does the
Psychonomic Society have any eugenics connections? As a member I’d like
to know.</p>
<p><span class="citation">Yakushko (2019b)</span> had mentioned that 31
APA presidents from 1892 - 1947 were involved in eugenics in explicit
ways (wrote on eugenics, members of eugenics societies, etc.). I found
this shocking, and have started noting connections between <a href="https://crumplab.github.io/blogposts/7_13_20_PsychEugenics/7_13_20_PsychEugenics.html" class="external-link">APA
presidents and eugenics</a>. My assessment so far is that there are more
than 31 APA presidents who were deeply into eugenics, and the history
certainly goes past 1947.</p>
<p>Some books I have found useful in describing the vast ways that
eugenics permeated society and psychology are the following: <span class="citation">Kühl (2013)</span> presents an astounding history of
the international organization of eugenics movements, including some
discussion of the organization of eugenics within the discipline of
psychology. If you thought eugenics was just a minor historical detail,
this book may change your mind. An important point here is that it is
worth determining how eugenicists organize themselves leadership
positions within societies and governments (e.g., the APA presidents).
These actions by eugenicists created deep structures of eugenics within
society that continue to reverberate today.</p>
<p><span class="citation">Yakushko (2019a)</span> presents a critical
look at some aspects of scientific psychology, especially those rooted
in eugenics and positive psychology. If you want a primer on some
atrocities committed by well-known psychologists, this is an eye-opener.
It may also challenge some of your notions about the role of psychology
as a science in society, at least when it comes to the difference
between science and scientism.</p>
<p>Last, <span class="citation">Wilson (n.d.)</span> discusses eugenics
in the context of Western Canada (I’m an Alberta boy), where the
eugenics policy of forced sterilization was legalized; and he develops a
“standpoint theory” of eugenics, which attempts to discuss eugenics from
a survivor perspective, as well as advocate for modern society to
understand hallmarks of eugenic thinking so as to guard against modern
versions of eugenics campaigns. Wilson was also the project director for
the wonderful website <a href="http://eugenicsarchive.ca" class="external-link uri">http://eugenicsarchive.ca</a>.</p>
<p>I found one story from Wilson very inspiring. It turns out the first
chair of the Philosophy/Psychology Department at the University of
Alberta was the same man who sat on the eugenics board and authorized
forced sterilizations until the law was repealed. That department has an
institutional legacy of eugenics. That department formed a sub committe
in 1998 to assess its own legacy of eugenics, and then respond in some
way for the purposes of restorative justice. I commend them for doing
that. More Departments need to do this. More societies need to do this.
Does Psychonomics need to do this? I don’t know, maybe so…let’s see.</p>
<p>A last word on labelling and offending people. As I am about to go
into my own academic backyard and start asking whether my own colleagues
have a history of espousing racist and eugenics ideology, I’m assuming
some feathers may be ruffled. My intention is to be constructive in
learning about these issues and eventually portraying them back to the
society (if there is anything to reflect on…haven’t yet started the
research). Certainly, some of the terminology may sound offensive,
perjorative, and disparaging. However, labels such as “white
racist-eugenicist-psychologist” are appopriate for psychologists, who
explicitly in their own writing, identify themselves in those terms. For
example, white racist-eugenicist-psychologists advocate for the
supremacy of the “Nordic races” through positive eugenic policies, and
advocate for the oppression,segregation and/or elimination of non-white
races through negative eugenics policies.</p>
<p>I’m still thinking through how to discuss connections between
eugenics and individual psychologists. For example, some psychologists
may justify a label of racist-eugenicist because of their explicit
self-identification under those terms, wherease, other psychologists may
not because of a lack of explicit evidence. Nevertheless, I’ll entertain
the concept of adjacency in considering connections between eugenics and
psychology. For example, many psychologists were trained by white racist
eugenicists, or worked on topic areas that are of high interest to
eugenicists. These psychologists are adjacent to eugenics in some
important ways, and may or may not espouse eugenics ideology. In any
case, I guess what I am saying is that I will attempt to use labels in a
way that elucidates eugenics connections in psychology, for the purposes
of understanding potential structural and systemic issues in our
discipline that may be fundamentally related to eugenics.</p>
<p>One question I have often wondered when I have attended Psychonomics
is “Why is Psychonomics so white?”. Given my newfound interest in
eugenics, I am interested in determining whether structural eugenics in
Psychology, including in Psychonomics could possibly explain some of the
overwhelming lack of diversity.</p>
<p>The above prelude is a work in progress where I am attempting to
explain/discover my motivations for doing this work (e.g., this blog is
unstable and under active revision, as you can tell from the typos and
awkward sentences).</p>

<h3 id="history-of-psychonomics">History of Psychonomics<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#history-of-psychonomics"></a>
</h3>
<p>I must confess I am a newbie when it comes to the history of
Psychology, and specifically the history of its organizational structure
in Canada and in the US. I’ve learned a couple things so far. E. G.
Boring (1928 APA president) is often credited with starting the History
of Psychology. When I read Boring, I find he doesn’t do a good job of
contextualizing the history of Psychology in terms of eugenics. I wonder
why (I have my suspicions), he certainly worked with and knew a whole
bunch of eugenicist psychologists, and it is incredible to believe that
he didn’t know about the ideologies of his colleagues. Maybe he thought
the eugenics part was so obvious it went without saying…or maybe
not.</p>
<p>As I write this I’m aware that I haven’t read all of the History of
Psych journals, so I don’t know whether or how they reconstruct the
history of Psychology from the lens of eugenics. Need to read more about
this for myself.</p>
<p>There is a tradition in American Psychology of breaking away from the
APA (American Psychological Association). The more I learn about the
APA, the more I understand why. Psychonomics broke away from the APA,
and before looking at that, I wanted to juxtapose the formation of
Psychonomics with the formation of another society, <a href="http://www.abpsi.org" class="external-link">The Association of Black Psychology</a> who
has been publishing the <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/home/jbp" class="external-link">Journal of Black
Psychology</a> since 1974. The ABPsi broke from the APA and in the last
half-century have constructed an entire new field in Psychology that is
notable for several reasons, including the pursuit of restorative
justice for the actions of white racist and eugenicist psychologists
against the Black Community. So, I wonder if Psychonomics broke away
from the APA for any related reasons…(edit: not so much).</p>

Psychonomics. Let’s start with the first paper.</p>
<p>Oops, I got interrupted. FYI, I’m going to write this like a
detective novel, so it will be contemporaneous with my discoveries, and
sometimes tangential. I admit, I already read the first paper, which is
why I am going to talk more about it here. At the end of the paper there
was some discussion about the word Psychonomics, and around that
discussion there was some word usage common among eugenic texts. So, I
ended up doing the thing I always do, but should have done from the
beginning, and that is, Google “Psychonomics and eugenics”. I did that
and I straightaway I found a paper <span class="citation">Cleland,
Swartz, and McGavern (1979)</span> published by the Psychonomic
Society:</p>
<p><img src="img/war.png" width="1262" style="display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<p>This is an indication to me that the society at one point condoned
aspects of eugenics, and also that some eugenics directed archaeology of
Psychonomics is necessary. (Edit: I recently learned that at this time
(1979) members could publish in this venue effectively without scrutiny,
so this paper could easily reflect more on the authors than on the
society. See the editorial from Morgan in the first issue).</p>

</h3>
<p>OK, back to the first paper on the history of Psychonomics. This one
is titled, “The founding of the Psychonomics society” <span class="citation">(Dewsbury and Bolles 1995)</span>. Before I go through
it, it’s worth reminding myself (I used to be a history major) what I
learned about “history” in undergrad.</p>
<p>There is opinion and perspective in historical retelling. So I need
to wonder, what lens is used here to discuss the beginnings of
Psychonomics?</p>
<p>Historical retellings often use the same kinds of tricks. For
example, <span class="citation">Wilson (n.d.)</span> refers to
Ebbinghaus’ quip that “psychology has a long past, but only a short
history”. Wilson uses this quip to point out a common narrative
structure in historical retelling. In histories of psychology as a
science we see the “long” pointers back to the early Greek philosophers.
It is often the case that “long” pointing is a way of using
juxtaposition to connect some current issue with the significance or
value of “well-accepted” historical figures. E.g., psychology continues
in the supremely wonderful and great tradition of the righteous and true
great traditions of the past…That kind of thing.</p>
<p>I’ll have an eye out for the “long” pointers as I “read between the
lines” of the “The founding of Psychonomics”. Let’s go.</p>
<p>Here’s the first bit of the paper:</p>
<p><img src="img/psycho1.png" width="761" style="display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<p>TLDR, the Psychonomics origin story begins with a bunch of white
dudes at a bar. I can totally relate to that, because that is pretty
much what my experience is like when I go to Psychonomics.</p>
<p>We learn that this meet-up was at an AAAS meeting (American
Association for the Advancement of Science). Now, far be it from me to
criticize the AAAS. And, I have not looked too closely at this
organization yet. Suffice it to say, let me connect the AAAS with an
important person in its history, James McKeen Cattell. Cattell is a
notable eugenicist, as well he was an APA president, and he founded
Psychological Review, and he bought Science and edited it for 50 years.
I haven’t read this paper yet, but it apparently covers some of the
eugenics aspects of AAAS <span class="citation">(Farber
2008)</span>.</p>
<p>OK, so some AAAS affiliated Psychologists go to a bar…and two years
later Psychonomics was born. Some of those psychologists were “Clarence
Graham of Columbia University, Clifford T. Morgan of Johns Hopkins, S.
S. Stevens of Harvard, and William S. Verplanck of Hunter College.” I
start looking at the scholarship of the organizers further down.</p>
<p>So, after the origin story, the founding of Pscyhonomics is set in
context of the tradition of splintering off from APA, which many other
groups do for various reasons.</p>
<p><img src="img/psycho2.png" width="368" style="display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<p>We are pulled back to into the living room of G. Stanley Hall in
1892, at the dawn of the APA. I would say that Hall was deeply into
eugenics, <a href="https://crumplab.github.io/blogposts/7_13_20_PsychEugenics/7_13_20_PsychEugenics.html#1892_granville_stanley_hall" class="external-link">for
some connections see</a>.</p>
<p>I think it is also fair to say that the first presidential address
published in the first issue of Psych Review in 1894 by George Trumball
Ladd (2nd APA president, also frequent contributor to the Journal of
Race Development…) was about establishing the place of psychology in
Science. From the very beginning the eugenicists involved in Psychology
were very eager to establish and maintain the scientific purity of
Psychology. This a theme that sometimes is used to give psychologists
cover to conduct “science” in a “value-free”, “objectively neutral” way
(see <span class="citation">Yakushko (2019a)</span> on scientism). FYI,
I also think that Ladd was dog-whistling to the eugenicists in the crowd
in his final thoughts about using psychology for the betterment of
society. It is also highly interesting to inspect the first issue of
Psych Review for known eugenicists (e.g., Francis Galton, founder of
eugenics, publishes on his ability to arithmetic by smell).</p>
<p>Next, we learn about some previous splits within the APA.</p>
<p><img src="img/psycho3.png" width="373" style="display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<p>Would you be surprised if Leta Hollingworth was a racist and
eugenicist? See here <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leta_Stetter_Hollingworth" class="external-link">wikipedia
page</a>. She was also married to another eugenicist psychologist Harry
Levi Hollingworth, who was president of the APA in 1927. You could read
Wallin’s eugenics here <span class="citation">(Wallin 1914)</span>. This
split didn’t last long and the APA recouped the AACP, and established
the first “section” in the APA. Neato, I didn’t know that.</p>
<p><img src="img/psycho4.png" width="363" style="display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<p>There is an acknowledgement of the role that WW II played in the
discipline of psychology. There are many connections between
psychologists and war efforts in the US, and without going into that
history, let me point out a primary theme is eugenics, and many of the
psychologists involved were also members of eugenics societies. We see
some mention of some other societies, like SEP (Society of Experimental
Psychologists)…notably this exclusive honor club of psychologists still
gives the Howard Crosby Warren medal every year. HC Warren was another
APA president (1913), and he is listed in the Eugenical News as an
active researcher. But, the main point of this paragraph is the
italicized two words “and practice”, whereby the new bylaws of the APA
included “practice” alongside science, as a way into the APA. It seems
like the scientists didn’t like this very much. They didn’t want the
science to be watered down. I get that.</p>
<p>We are then treated to a context of previous attempts to make
scientific clubs of psychologists, where psychologists could just
finally hang out and be scientists with each other.</p>
<p><img src="img/p5.png" width="438" style="display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<p>The experimentalists were notable misogynists, and they grew into the
SEP, which maintained its misogynistic roots. I won’t go into the
membership of SEP, because this about Psychonomics, and SEP is another
day.</p>
<p><img src="img/p6.png" width="437" style="display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<p>Part of the point in this history could be to establish the “long”
roots of Psychonomics by tying it to preceding exclusive honor
societies. There is much cross-fertilization between the societies, as
noted throughout this paper (and even today).</p>
<p>Next, we learn about earlier efforts by Titchener’s group to create
scientific space within APA conferences of the 20s.</p>
<p><img src="img/p7.png" width="448" style="display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<p>I haven’t found Titchener connect himself with eugenics in his
writing, but Boring is certainly eugenics adjacent (having with worked
with Yerkes in the army IQ testing effort). Dallenbach and Fernberger I
don’t know much about. Dallenbach was on an NRC committee with several
other known eugenics proponents. Fernberger wrote a biography for HC
Warren, wrote on “the problem of mental disorders”, and seems eugenics
adjacent at first glance. J. E. Anderson was APA president in 1943, and
wrote “The Modern baby Book and Child Development Record”, which follows
in the footsteps of Galton’s eugenics approach. Raymond Dodge was APA
president in 1916, did some IQ testing during the war, and supported
some eugenics policies, but doesn’t appear to be a major public advocate
of eugenics. Haven’t looked into Robinson, but he writes about the great
need to apply science to “the problem of public intelligence”. Shepard
like many his contemporaries worked in testing of the military during
the war.</p>
<p>It seems that this effort of organization didn’t really work, and the
group fizzled.</p>
<p><img src="img/p8.png" width="462" style="display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<p>But, it’s interesting that very notable people (“stalwarts”) were in
attendance: Harvey Carr, Clark Hull, Joseph Jastrow, H. C. Warren, and
Robert S. Woodworth. T. All of these men were deeply into eugenics, and
they were also all one-time presidents of the APA <a href="https://crumplab.github.io/blogposts/7_13_20_PsychEugenics/7_13_20_PsychEugenics.html" class="external-link">see
some notes on each here</a>.</p>
<p>Huh, next we learn about another fascinating society in Psychology,
the psychological round table, or PRT…If you followed my twitter account
last summer, you would know that I tweeted a bunch about them. They are
a “well-kept-secret” honor society that still exists today. They have a
smelly history of misogyny. They keep their member list close to their
chests. Who knows what their members think about eugenics? It’s just one
of those questions that has to be asked in a blog post using the lens of
eugenics to explore this paper.</p>
<p><img src="img/p9.png" width="451" style="display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<p><img src="img/p10.png" width="440" style="display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<p>I think the TLDR here is that Psychonomics should be proud that among
its founders were esteemed members of PRT. Congrats, give yourself a pat
on the back.</p>
<p>PRT had GUV as a sister “secret society”, so ya. Hi GUV friends,
wave.</p>
<p><img src="img/p11.png" width="445" style="display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<p>Again we have a list of names of well known psychologists. I’ll point
to one small puzzle. I know C. W. Eriksen because he invented the
flanker task. I’ve been asking myself, what does that have to do with
eugenics? After all, I have used that task on numerous occasions. Well,
the puzzle is not about the flanker task. Nope, it is why does C. W.
Eriksen appear in a footnote in Kuhl’s <span class="citation">(Kühl
2013)</span> book on eugenics? It’s because Eriksen was among several
other psychologists (with eugenics connections) who signed a letter
supporting <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Jensen" class="external-link">Arthur
Jensen</a>, who has often been characterized as a racist
psychologist.</p>
<p>from Kuhl: “The ten other scholars were Jack A. Adams, Raymond B.
Cattell, Francis H. Crick, C. D. Darlington, Charles W. Eriksen, Eric F.
Gardner, Quinn McNemar, Eliot Slater, Robert L. Thorndike, Frederick C.
Thorne, and Philip E. Vernon; cf. JBA Oxford, G. 14. The activity was at
first coordinated by the psychologist Ellis B. Page of the University of
Connecticut; cf. Jensen to Dobzhansky, 9/2/1972, THA Philadelphia:
Jensen, Arthur R.”</p>
<p>Anyway, let’s continue with the paper.</p>
<p><img src="img/p12.png" width="447" style="display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<p>Interesting, I did not know that there was a failed attempt to remove
division 3 (exp in psych) from APA in 1948. But, I certainly have
learned about big names in Experimental Psychology who were eugenicists,
like Thorndike, Watson and Lashley. I haven’t looked at Spence or
Graham. For Spence I will just point out that we worked under Yerkes and
Hull, so it seems very likely he was exposed to his mentors’ eugenics.
It would be interesting to look at Spence’s scholarship from the lens of
the eugenics ideology of his mentors. (edit: I do that a bit later).</p>
<p>Alright, we have arrived at the beginning of the Psychonomics
Society:</p>
<p><img src="img/p13.png" width="453" style="display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<p>Let’s take a look at the table events:</p>
<p><img src="img/p14.png" width="458" style="display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<p>More names:</p>
<p><img src="img/p15.png" width="439" style="display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<p>And a table of membership of the organizing committee (from the
American Men of Science):</p>
<p><img src="img/p16.png" width="440" style="display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<p>Interesting to note the ages, so many members were all kicked out of
PRT and GUV.</p>
<p>More people get involved. I love how “diverse” and “white males” was
working into the paragraph.</p>
<p><img src="img/p17.png" width="443" style="display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<p>There was some discussion and dissent about the purposes and
directions of the new society. I wonder how much of that discussion had
to do with restorative justice for survivors of eugenics at that time. I
wasn’t there, maybe it wasn’t on the radar.</p>
<p><img src="img/p18.png" width="448" style="display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<p>Some of the tension in the story appears to be the need to fight for
science in psychology, and to make a society that shows everyone why
science and psychology is so important. A story like this has been
drilled into me over the years. IMO, science shouldn’t be an excuse to
do psychology.</p>
<p><img src="img/p19.png" width="443" style="display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<p>And now, we go back to the bar:</p>
<p><img src="img/p20.png" width="446" style="display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<p>Should I go to Appendix D now, or later…it’s choose your own
adventure. Let’s do it, Appendix D says :</p>
<p><img src="img/p21.png" width="797" style="display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<p>For my two cents, the part at the bottom resonates very strongly. It
seems there was an elitist contingent from the PRT. Ever wonder why
graduate students don’t give talks at Psychonomics? Maybe this is why.
The elitists won.</p>
<p>Back to the paper. So, 950 invitations were sent out to potential
members, the name Psychonomics was adopted and incorporated in 1960.
There is an appendix on the name “Psychonomics”. I’ll get to that
later.</p>
<p>“The First Annual Scientific Meeting of the Psychonomic Society The
first meeting of the Psychonomic Society was held at the University of
Chicago on September 1-3, 1960, just before the 1960 APA meetings.
Approximately 294 individuals attended, of whom 195were members, 79 were
guests, and approximately 20 were unregistered. The program included 119
papers in 24 sessions arranged in eight time blocks with three
concurrent sessions each; four blocks on Thursday, three blocks and an
afternoon business meeting on Friday, and one block on Saturday morning.
They were grouped into 15 categories. The nature of the experimental
psychology ofthe time, at least for the members of the new Psychonomic
Society, can be seen in the distribution of papers across sessions;
these are presented in Table 3.”</p>
<p>Let’s look at Table 3:</p>
<p><img src="img/p22.png" width="371" style="display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<p>Oh no, it seems that the potpourri session has basically disappeared
in terms of modern Psychonomics. Now, should I stay or should I go find
the 1960 conference abstracts. I guess I should do that. I’m going to do
that now, wish me luck.</p>
<p>No dice yet, couldn’t find the conference abstracts after a quick
search. Not sure which archive they are in. In any case, it would be
interesting read about the genetics session and a few others.</p>
<p>Well, maybe spoke to soon. I can do things like search “paper
presented to the Psychonomic Society, 2 September 1960” in Google
scholar, and restrict the dates to 1960. Then a few papers that were
read at psychonomics in 1960 come up. A start anyway. Here’s an example,
still would be nice to get the full list at some point.</p>
<ul>
<li>Jerison, H. J. (1961). Quantitative analysis of evolution of the
brain in mammals. Science, 133(3457), 1012-1014.</li>
</ul>
<p>Alright, some stuff happened at the first conference. We learn that
it wasn’t really too much different than division 3 APA conferences.
Then there is the first business meeting, a first newsletter, etc.</p>
<p>Some thorns in the side, or additional reasons why Psychonomics
needed to be created, it seems APA was making actual presentations of
research more difficult. Kind of funny to imagine Estes’ apparatus
solution to the problem.</p>
<p><img src="img/p23.png" width="439" style="display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<p>It seems that Psychonomics could be the place where science happened,
and still be affiliated with the APA</p>
<p><img src="img/p24.png" width="432" style="display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<p>What’s in a name…Also, more in the appendix, which I will get to
later. Also, some icky quotes in here…what’s on page 5 !!!</p>
<p><img src="img/p25.png" width="435" style="display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<p>Some membership features:</p>
<p><img src="img/p26.png" width="438" style="display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<p>I guess this part went out the window, said the fellow researching
the foundations of the fellow-less society he is a fellow of.</p>
<p><img src="img/p27.png" width="436" style="display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<p>There was a distinct lack of diversity:</p>
<p><img src="img/p28.png" width="432" style="display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<p>So this is why Psychonomics is just about coffee…keeps the cost of
the conference down though (and I very much appreciate that…Also, I
should say I very much appreciate Psychonomics, and the only reason I am
spending this much time looking into the history of Psychonomics is
because of how much I appreciate this society.)</p>
<p><img src="img/p29.png" width="446" style="display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<p>Then some more stuff about restricting papers and talks to members.
LET THE GRADUATE STUDENTS GIVE TALKS ALREADY.</p>
<p>Governance structure is supposedly lean and in the style of PRT…not
sure if that is good or bad. I’ve never been involved with governance at
Psychonomics. Can’t say anything about what it’s like now.</p>
<p><img src="img/p30.png" width="433" style="display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<p>Psychonomics journals didn’t work out right away, but eventually
started happening, courtesy of Clifford Morgan.</p>
<p>The concluding paragraph.</p>
<p><img src="img/p31.png" width="432" style="display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<p>So a simple history of Psychonomics is that it is a lean organization
for scientific psychologists to talk about their science. And it is does
that very well.</p>
<p>Societies have many members and viewpoints and it’s unclear what
kinds of views Psychonomics members have had over time about issues such
as eugenics, or about tolerating or not tolerating other members’ views
on such issues.</p>
<hr>
<p>Time for a small break.</p>
<p>Aside from eugenics, I wonder how many folks from the governing board
of Psychonomics and say all of the journals are also members of PRT and
GUV? I would guess quite a few. If so, there is a “hidden” layer of
elitism to the society, and if you are not part of the club…like moi,
then I guess sucks to be you (or me as it happens).</p>

<h3 id="naming-psychonomics">Naming Psychonomics<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#naming-psychonomics"></a>
</h3>
<p>On the naming of Psychonomics from the appendix:</p>
<p><img src="img/p32.png" width="744" style="display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<p>I’ll point out that James Mark Baldwin also wrote, “The mental
development in the child and race: methods and processes (Baldwin,
1900)”. And, that curiously the word “flow” is often used in eugenics
literature (see chpt 6 of <span class="citation">Yakushko
(2019a)</span>). These are obviously juxtaposition to eugenics, and I
don’t know the eugenics literature well enough yet to know if there are
additional connections. Anyway, I thought these connections were worth
noting.</p>
<p>The rest of the appendix reads:</p>
<p><img src="img/p33.png" width="672" style="display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<p>I’ve had a little bit more time to look at “Psychonomic” in the
context of eugenics and social darwinism, and I found that it also has a
meaning in terms of the “general psychonomic law”. I found this in a
footnote from <span class="citation">Goodchild (2012)</span> who
discusses G. Stanley Hall (one-time APA president and eugenicist)</p>
<p>“Cremin, Transformation of the School, 101–2. Cremin described Hall’s
foundational idea exceptionally well. “Hall’s basic thesis—the ‘general
psychonomic law,’ which he borrowed from Haeckel and Spencer—was that
ontogeny, the development of the indi- vidual organism, recapitulates
phylogeny, the evolution of the race.”</p>
<p>I dunno, seems like the general psychonomic law also has a meaning in
terms of eugenics writing. Or maybe I’m just reading way too much into
this. Here’s Hall in his own words…</p>
<p><img src="img/p34.png" width="455" style="display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<p>Yup, psychonomics is a word that also has meaning in eugenics
writing. So, there’s that.</p>
<p>A final thought on this is the historical tradition of harkening back
to something of perceived value. Is it possible that in establishing a
new society, the founders chose the word “Psychonomics” to harken back
to the beginning of the APA, and reference the eugenics writings of the
first APA president, G. Stanley Hall? It’s a question that falls out of
the eugenic analysis lens.</p>
<hr>
<p>There are three more papers on the history of Psychonomics on their
website, and I’ll read those a little bit later. Some of the next steps
that I should take include looking more closely at the scholarship of
the organizers. Considering the large amount of eugenics oriented
research in the APA up to this time, and considering that Psychonomics
was mainly planning to be a society that continued APA division 3
research, it would be surprising if the early days of Psychonomics did
not include eugenics oriented research.</p>
<p>At the same time, we are now talking about 1960 and onward, a time in
history when it became more unpopular to use the word eugenics (often
attributed to widespread public rejection of eugenics following
revelations of Nazi war crimes), and to talk openly about promoting
eugenics. So, unlike pre 1945 where it was rather easy to line up
psychologists who published in psychology and eugenics journals, or
otherwise self-identified as being a eugenicist, it seems like more of a
challenge to determine whether psychologists in the 60s were involved in
eugenics.</p>
<p>Before I start to look more closely at the scholarship of organizing
members, I’d like to mention a few points of interest. For myself, I
have been wondering about the connections between eugenics and the
cognitive revolution. Psychonomics appears right in the same time frame
as the cognitive revolution. I have spent many years thinking about
cognition, and basically never thought of myself as contributing in
anyway to programs of eugenics. I’ve been asking basic questions about
basic psychological processes. How is that related to eugenics?</p>
<p>In any case, here are a few tidbits that have started to inform my
thinking about the cognitive revolution. First, it is obvious that the
history of individual differences psychology is tightly interwoven with
eugenics. The development of IQ testing and psychometrics were employed
as tools of eugenics many times over in many different venues in
society. It was less obvious to me how experimental psychology was
involved. One way was that many formative psychologists in experimental
psychology were eugenicists, Thorndike, Watson, Lashley, Hull…the list
goes on.</p>
<p>At one point I jumped ahead of myself (in terms of going through the
APA presidents), and I looked George A. Miller &amp; eugenics. Most of
us know Miller for his magic number 7 + or - 2 paper. That paper was
also about applying ideas from Claude Shannon’s information theory to
information processing limitations in psychology. Well, guess where
Claude Shannon did his master’s thesis. At the eugenics record office in
Cold Springs Harbor (Long Island New York). This is one of those weird
eugenics connections.</p>
<p>It took some googling but eventually I found George Miller explain
his version of eugenics in 1967 in <span class="citation">Miller
(1967)</span>. Miller inverts a common fear of morons that eugenicists
usually foment about. Eugenicists like H. Goddard <span class="citation">(Goddard 1927)</span> exclaim that morons are
everywhere, they look like everyone else, but they are morons because of
their IQ, and they must be removed from society or else society will
collapse. Miller, in his futurism about the year 2000, says the society
will become too complex rendering everyone morons, so basically we need
to do something about it or else. Miller cryptically talks about when
“the day comes that we have the necessary facts to support a realistic
eugenics program, such information could be valuable.” Miller doesn’t
say who he wishes to eliminate, he’s cryptic. Still, he thanks his buddy
R.J. Hernnstein at the beginning, probably for all the chats about
eugenics (Hernnstein would later publish “the Bell curve”).</p>
<p>Still, what did this have to do with cognition? Well, Miller also
explains how it obvious that information processing capacity needs to be
increased in order for society to survive. It’s plain old
Intelligence-exalting, fear-mongering, Galtonian eugenics with fancy
words. So, there is some ideology between Miller’s magic number. And it
apparently has to do with eugenics.</p>
<p>Second, although I still have to confirm this, it appears that
Abraham Maslow was deeply into eugenics, but only wrote about it
privately, and this was only made generally available to public upon
publishing of some of his private notes.</p>
<p>I mention these two examples primarily because it may be difficult to
suss out eugenic ideology among psychologists who don’t share their
views publicly, but continue nevertheless to conduct science that has
eugenic implications. So, it’s a bit of a warning to myself to not get
carried away with wondering if someone is really a eugenicist or not.
It’s not for me to decide. One of primary aims is to document more
clearly the structural eugenics aspects. In other words, I think at some
point it will become clear enough that there was a bunch of eugenics
going on, and that this shaped our discipline, and if this is true, it
is something Psychonomics has to deal with.</p>

<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="psychonomics-originators">Psychonomics Originators<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#psychonomics-originators"></a>
</h3>
<p>Eugenicists were very good at getting into the APA, especially as APA
presidents. They were also very good at sitting as chairmen in US
government committees (see the NRC 1919-1933 division of anthropology
&amp; Psychology). It would be kind of astounding to me if there was no
interest among eugenicists in having a piece of Psychonomics from the

<p>Also, what follows are personal notes, sometimes interspersed with
“maybe” eugenic-adjacent things, sometimes things I’m interested in
returning to for other reasons. After all, even though I have an
interest in learning about psychology from the lens of eugenics, this is
likewise an opportunity for me to learn about people I didn’t know about
before.</p>

<li>from Wikipedia: In the 1970s, Humphreys chaired the American
Psychological Association’s Task Force on ability and achievement
testing. He deemed a general intelligence test “the single most
important test that can be administered for vocational guidance
purposes” (Humphreys, 1985, p. 211). He also coined the concept
“inadequate learning syndrome” (ILS) and argued it was a more important
social problem than the AIDS epidemic (Humphreys, 1988).</li>
<li>Amid the controversy generated by publication of The Bell Curve in
1994, Humphreys wrote a target article (Humphreys, 1994), which
stimulated a series of comments by a number of prominent scholars in the
field. He generated further controversy by accepting funding from the
Pioneer Fund. He was also one of 52 signatories on “Mainstream Science
on Intelligence,[3]” an editorial written by Linda Gottfredson and
published in the Wall Street Journal, which defended the findings on
intelligence in The Bell Curve.</li>

papers that are eugenics adjacent IMO, but it mostly seems like fairly
standard Psychonomics fare. It’s really great most of these papers are
open access, I love this about Psychonomics. The journal also publishes
some of the abstracts from Psychonomics conferences. I took a quick look
at a few of them, and didn’t see any more papers with eugenics in the

<p>This is a new journal, and in general I think use-based cognitive
research is pretty great, so there is much to like about this journal. I
haven’t submitted anything here, but I do some work on cognitive
technologies, such as with the <a href="https://www.semanticlibrarian.com" class="external-link">semantic librarian
project</a>.</p>
<p>The words “eugenic” and “eugenics” don’t appear yet in this journal.
It’s a new journal and probably many researchers, like me only a couple
weeks ago, aren’t thinking about eugenics everyday or at all. I could
imagine the story of eugenics in psychology as it relates to “use-based”
practices of “psychological research” being relevant to guiding modern
discussion of applied cognitive research.</p>
<hr>
<p>Interim question: Why doesn’t the word eugenics appear more often in
Psychonomics journals?</p>
<p>I’m not wondering about the absence of papers that explicitly
advocate in favor of eugenics (it is still pretty wierd that there are
papers like this in the Psychonomic record). I’m wondering about the
distinct lack of discussion and contextualization of reseach in terms of
eugenics. For example, there doesn’t appear to be a paper that examines
historical and contemporary research aims and methods in Psychonomics
from the lens of eugenics. Maybe, I’m just motivating myself to fill a
gap in the literature.</p>
<p>For example, there are numerous papers about “intelligence”. And,
even though that area has extensive connections to eugenics, and remains
a controversial area, it doesn’t appear that these issues are discussed
directly in papers that use the word intelligence. (I’m inferring this
by the fact that searching “intelligence AND eugenics” returns zero
results).</p>

<p>I would never recommend reading the journal “Mankind Quarterly”.
However, it is interesting to read one author’s perspective on the
founding of Psychonomics, in the paper title “Raymond B Cattell and the
Fourth Inquisition”, by W Glade. Basically, Cattell is a racist and the
APA declines to give him an award even though he showed up to receive
it. Anyway, it’s a head spinning dose of WTF. Nevertheless, the claim is
that Psychonomics scientists were tired of this kind of “leftist” crap,
and left APA because it was getting too “political”.</p>

<p>These pieces are not about psychonomics, but I came across them

<p>What is interesting about these reviews is that both authors
illustrate how to talk elliptically or cryptically about ideas that loom
over the discipline. Both reviews are about conference
books/proceedings, and both authors use subtext and allusion to
reference ideologies that appear to loom large at the conferences. Could
be fun to read the book review sections of AJP! More broadly, this time
period is very different from the earlier decades in terms of open
discussion of the subtext. For example, in decades prior some
eugenicists published their views in eugenics journals and their methods
in psychology journals. That kind of parallelism of ideology and method
isn’t very common anymore, making dot connection more difficult.</p>

<p>SEP is a long-standing honorary society in Psychology. Many towering
figures in Psychology are members. I confess to not knowing very much
about the society beyond some of the people on the member list. I don’t
know how that society reflects upon its associations with eugenics that
exist via its own membership. Eugenics was certainly widespread and
socially acceptable from 1904 onward for many decades, and many
Psychologists were committed to eugenics movements. Some of these
psychologists were members of SEP.</p>
<p>I’ll look at the early members from a paper by E Boring, shared from
the SEP website. This is the 1904-1938 time period. The members in order
of being elected to the society were:</p>
<p><img src="img/SEP.png" width="419" style="display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<p>It’s interesting to cross-reference this list of members with lists
of memberships from Eugenics societies, lists from eugenical news, and
other potentially revealing sources like who C Davenport corresponded
with. E.g., here are a couple:</p>

<p>Ok, let’s do some cross-referencing…I don’t have a very good system
for this. These kinds of lists have some overlap, but not too much.
There’s a handful of SEP members (e.g., Seashore, Dunlap, Woodworth,
Yerkes, Poffenberger) that appear on these lists. I’ve started with an
excel spreadsheet, but I’m not happy with that method. There are other
connections besides membership affiliations. I need to do some thinking
about a database approach…</p>

<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="database-thoughts">Database thoughts<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#database-thoughts"></a>
</h3>
<p>Consider the problem of assessing possible associations between
eugenics and members of a psychology society. So far I’ve been taking a
rough collection approach going through the APA presidents, organizers
of Psychonomcis, and now looking at SEP. The approach has been to state
a name, and then copy some notes about factoids and references that
might be relevant in terms of eugenics connections. Once in a while
there are some explicit signs, such as being a member of eugenics
society.</p>
<p>I’d like some way of assessing these connections more
programmatically, such that I apply some kind of similar standard to
everyone in terms assessing eugenics associations. Maybe things are just
more complicated than this, and every person has their own unique story
(of course, this is true too).</p>
<p>I need to reflect on what I’m actually trying to accomplish in this
research. It started off as an interesting subject matter that I felt
compelled to learn more about. An early thought was that I might be
better able to understand aspects of institutional racism in Psychology.
For example, if it was true that there was widespread eugenics within
Psychology for a long time, especially in the organizations and
leadership of Psychology organizations, then perhaps this legacy is
responsible for aspects of today’s psychology. And, identifying and
describing these insititutional features could then hopefully lead to
some deconstruction and reconstruction.</p>
<p>I am still mainly interested in characterizing the institutional
aspects of eugenics in psychology, as well as how our modern
institutions have reacted to the history. I am not that interested in
what specific people “really” thought about issues of the day. For many,
I’m sure that eugenics was rationalized as a great morally progressive
project for society. Probably also some people changed their minds on
committments to various ideologies over time.</p>
<p>My view is that eugenics campaigns were waged on people in society in
numerous ways. There are many differnent kinds of eugenics survivors.
Psychologists were active and complicit in many ways in eugenics
campaigns. This side of psychology should be acknowledged more
often.</p>
<p>Anyway, I’ve lost the thread, I’m supposed to be thinking about
databases. What kind of database would I want to have?</p>
<p>Let’s go back to the list of SEP members. What kind of database could
be useful to ask questions about eugenics activities and each
member?</p>
<p>Narrative descriptions. One way to go is to do a biography of each
person, entertain the lens of eugenics, and then make some judgment
calls, and say a few words in summary about the level or nature of their
eugenics activities. This is probably the best to way to portray the
nuance of the issues for each person. This would take some time.</p>
<p>Sadly, I have no training in qualitative research, and I’m a hack
historian.</p>
<p>However, I have been eyeing something for a while, maybe it could be
useful here. I have been developing “semantic” search engines for text
corpora using cognitive models of semantics (corpus-based distributional
models like BEAGLE). Several examples are available here, including the
abstracts from the last Psychonomics conference <a href="https://www.semanticlibrarian.com" class="external-link uri">https://www.semanticlibrarian.com</a>.</p>
<p>I’ve been meaning to take the semantic librarian project into the
domain of digital humanities. For example, could a tool for document
similarity analysis based on cognitive models be useful in the context
of historical research? Maybe a semantic librarian could be helpful
here.</p>
<p>TBH, I’ve been anticipating a day like today for a while. For
example, I’ve been trying to make semantic librarian’s easier to use by
sharing R code necessary to create your own <a href="https://crumplab.github.io/RsemanticLibrarian/" class="external-link uri">https://crumplab.github.io/RsemanticLibrarian/</a>. Most of
the semantic librarians I’ve built are for abstracts, so they are
structured in a particular way that supports searching by author and
year etc. However, there is a much more general notion to the semantic
librarian, which is a kind of semantic mixed-methods database. The
minimal example is here <a href="https://crumplab.github.io/RsemanticLibrarian/articles/Alice.html" class="external-link uri">https://crumplab.github.io/RsemanticLibrarian/articles/Alice.html</a>.
Actually, the best example a wine “Sommeantic Librarian” that I made
with a mixed database (basically wine reviews coded by several factors)
<a href="https://crumplab.shinyapps.io/somme/" class="external-link uri">https://crumplab.shinyapps.io/somme/</a>.</p>
<p>So, partly I guess I’m sayng I should use this stuff here somehow.
The semantic librarian approach will take a while. And, sure I could
create semantic vector for eugenics and then compare similarity to names
and authors in the database. That would be interesting I suspect, but it
would be difficulty to know what the similarity scores actually
represent. Still, something worth doing I think.</p>
<p>Aside from that, I could try some related methods.</p>
<p>I’m imagining each person as a JSON object, where each person can
have properties.</p>
<ul>
<li>Person = Name
<ul>
<li>eugenics = total score?</li>
<li>Properties
<ul>
<li>eugenics membership: TRUE/FALSE</li>
<li>eugenics in private correpsondence: TRUE/FALSE</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Something like the above, where it could be expandable as I learn
that I need to add different kinds of attributes, and then I could
develop some way of assessing the “data” for each person, potentially
assigning a eugencis score.</p>
<p>At the end of the day it would be nice to figure out these kinds of
flavors about individuals</p>
<ul>
<li>pro and active in eugenics</li>
<li>anti-eugenics</li>
<li>not involved or associated in eugenics</li>
<li>accidental eugenics</li>
<li>eugenics adjacent</li>
<li>functional contributions in the service of eugenics</li>
</ul>
<p>I guess I’m most interested in assessing a society or organization
for its functional contributions to eugenics, as a way of determining
the amount and quality of instutional/systemic eugenics for an
organization. So, obviously I need to take heed of SS Stevens, and do a
better job of operationalizing these things.</p>

stand, and commit to work and perspectives on the work that actively
guard against eugenics.</td>
