<p>I’m working through the task of learning about influences of eugenics on psychology and society. As a part of this, I’m documenting the eugenics views held by many psychologists, as well as connections between psychologists and eugenics. I will keep updating this page as I document the connections. There are many connections, it will take some time. So far, this is an emerging disorganized collection of factoids.</p>
<p>A major overarching goal of compiling and documenting connections between psychology and eugenics is to better understand how strucutural eugenics and racism in the discipline of Psychology has shaped and continues to shape the field, both in terms of the questions it asks, and who gets to ask them.</p>

<li>from <a href="http://www.cyberus.ca/~pballan/Pillfina.htm" class="external-link">http://www.cyberus.ca/~pballan/Pillfina.htm</a>: This personal brush with political prejudice did not change Pillsbury’s official scientific stance on race and mental degeneracy. His Education as the Psychologist Sees It (1920), for instance, was part of a successful nationwide postwar marketing campaign advocating the use of new group “mental testing” techniques in American schools. Here, Pillsbury uncritically combined past eugenic twin-studies with the new “Army Alpha and Beta” intelligence testing data. Surprisingly, his personal conclusion after thirty-three years of teaching is “that one can never produce intelligence by education, that one must begin much farther back in actually insuring the birth of intelligent people” (p. 46). [p. 525] At this time, however, Pillsbury was just one of many psychologists who accepted such notions (e.g., R. M. Yerkes, Psychological Examination in the United States Army [1921]; W. S. Hunter, General Psychology [1919]; R. S. Woodworth, Psychology [1921]).</li>

<li>Might be worth reading Hunter’s delayed reaction research in animals and children <span class="citation">(Hunter 1917)</span>.

</h2>
<p>I need to pause for a bit. I’ve been quickly trying to sketch out some connections between APA presidents and eugenics. Mostly this involves googling their name and eugenics, and pulling the string.</p>
<p>My main aim in making these connections is to draw attention to the larger pattern of institutional eugenics within the discipline of Psychology. I am less interested about whether or not specific individuals were “card-carrying” eugenicists, or really truly held eugenics views in their “soul” or not. I think it is enough to establish the pattern and spread of eugenic ideology to consider how eugenics shaped the discipline. For example, I suspect that rampant eugenics had a part to play in systemically limiting the diversity of faculty in Psychology. I suspect it also guided the questions we ask, and continue to ask.</p>
<p>So, as a part of reflecting on what I am doing, I drew up a quick spreadsheet of the APP presidents. For the first 50, I gave them each a eugenics score from 0 to 1, with some intermediate scores representing eugenics adjacent work. These are just some rough personal qualitative estimates, to put a number on things. My rough numberization adds up to 34.75 of 50 APA presidents were into eugenics or eugenics adjacent research. Very few were ever explicitly anti-eugenics.</p>
<p>Consider a sentence like, “It is overwhelming the case that the first 50 years of American Psychology as measured by APA presidents research interests and leadership demonstrate that the discpline of psychology was primarily constructed as arm of the national eugenics movement in the USA”. I just wrote that sentence, and I’m starting to think that I’m not exaggerating.</p>

<li>“Hobart Mowrer was an advocate of the idea that mental illness has a substantial biological and genetic basis. He held this conviction in spite of his equally strong belief in the importance of the”pathogenic secret.” Mowrer accepted the importance of biological factors at a time when many people did not, and was in this respect ahead of his time. He regarded his own affliction as in some sense a “gift,” the driving force behind his innovative ideas, but also the great misery of his life.”</li>

<li>“Student-led protests, sometimes violent in nature, against public appearances by Jensen, Eysenck, and Shockley produced a situation wherein they perceived a dichotomy between politically blinded critics and “pure” scholars, who were subject to psychoterror, attempts at intimidation, and death threats.123 Eysenck, Jensen, and Herrnstein, in conjunction with ten other American and British academics, suc- ceeded in initiating a resolution defending them against “personal and professional disparagement.”124 Here they placed the criticism that they received for their theory of inheritance in the same tradition as the persecution of “well-known scientist victims, includ[ing],Galileo, in orthodox Italy; Darwin, in Victorian England; Einstein, in Hitler’s Germany; and Mendelian biologists, in Stalin’s Russia.”125 Many of the attacks against the heredity researchers were seen to be made by “non- scientists” or “outspoken enemies of a scientific attitude.” Attacks were also deemed to come from “academics who had determined that any explanation of differences among humans could be traced to the environmental theory.” In the light of the widespread “environment oriented orthodoxy,” there was practically a “witch hunt” against those who held ideas based on heredity or a wish to develop further research work in the area of the biological bases of behavior.</li>

<p>Part of the impetus for all of this research is to characterize the widespread acceptance of eugenics in terms of institutions. So far my perspective is that psychology as a discipline has a problem with instutional forms of eugenics and racism. Institutional eugenics is term that could carry broad meaning from literal institutions (e.g., such as the APA), to widely adopted policies in society inspired and propagated by eugenics leaders (e.g., IQ testing).</p>

<p>How have institutions with some involvement in eugenics responded to their involvement? I’ve been wondering about this question the whole time that I’ve learning about eugenics. With respect to eugenics I’m still in the “what happened” phase, and perhaps slowly coming to the “what happened next” phase, which could lead into the “what’s going on right now phase”.</p>
<p>In any case. When I have time I will extract this section and make a post out of it to keep track of info I’m finding. I’ve discovered the internet archive <a href="https://archive.org" class="external-link uri">https://archive.org</a> contains an ample amount of historical eugenics literature, so have been collecting some of it. It’s also interesting to search for indvidual psychologists in this database because all sorts of old textbooks come up. More recently, I’ve started coming across government documents, for example the National Research Council has convened multiple panels to assess the impact of certain practices on society, some of these include eugenics related practices.</p>

<p>Look up Psychologists of the IFEO psychology committee, like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Stephenson_(psychologist)" class="external-link">W. Stephenson</a></p>
<p>The American eugeni- cists continued their research and publication activity unhindered, and in August 1915, 55 the National Conference for Race Betterment met for the second time</p>
<p>the antiracist reinterpretation of the American army intelligence tests in the First World War by the New York anthropologist Otto Klineberg</p>
<p>The second committee, which included the British eugenicists and psychologists Charles Spearman and W. R. S. Stephenson as well as the American researcher on race Morris Steggerda was tasked with making uniform the intelligence tests developed in Europe and America and revising these tests in a way that they could be used for the “psychological examination” of “non- European and primitive peoples.”67 In that way, not only could a direct evaluation of each individual be made possible, but the presumably intellectual abilities and characteristics of the races could be shown quantitatively.</p>
<p>The IFEO Commission for Race Psychiatry that was set up in 1930 was assigned the task of bringing out these differences in the mental and psychological constitu- tion of races.</p>

<p>The psychologist Clariette Armstrong, a former member of the Eugenics Research Association, testi- fied to the court for the IAAEE how great a hardship it would be for the Negro child to be in school with brighter, younger Whites, leading to greater delinquency, and so on.59 The IAAEE published and distributed arguments by Henry E.

<p>pg 171 in kuhl Arthur Jensen,</p>
<p>Hans J. Eysenck</p>
<p>Richard Herrnstein, a psychologist at Harvard University, picked up on Jensen’s and Eysenck’s hypotheses.</p>
<p>J. Philippe Rushton, a Canadian professor of psychology, not only received exten- sive support from the Pioneer Fund but after the turn of the century also took over leadership of the fund.</p>
<p>Eysenck, Jensen, and Herrnstein, in conjunction with ten other American and British academics, suc- ceeded in initiating a resolution defending them against “personal and professional disparagement.”124</p>
<p>For many years a large part of the project funds of the Pioneer Fund went for a research project on twins at the University of Minnesota, but the fund has also been involved in almost every piece of research that is intended to determine the psy- chological differences between the races.144 Arthur Jensen alone between 1971 and 1992 received over a million dollars. J. Phillippe Rushton in the same period was able to receive over $770,000 in grant funds from Pioneer. William Shockley, who promoted breeding of the highly gifted and to this end made his own sperm avail- able, received about $200,000 for his various activities in the area of race research. Other race researchers as well, such as the professor of education and psychologist R. Travis Osborne, the psychologist Richard Lynn, the sociologist and professor of education Linda Gottfredson, the sociologist Robert Gordon, and the philosopher Michael Levin, received generous amounts from the Pioneer Fund.145</p>
<p>Mankind Quarterly, he attempted to reinforce international visibility in particular by taking European and American scientists onto the editorial board. He made sure that the eugenic orienta- tion of the journal stayed true by expanding the editorial board with such persons as the Italian anthropologist Bruno Chiarelli, the psychologist Raymond B. Catell,</p>
