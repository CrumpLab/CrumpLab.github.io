<p>I’m working through the task of learning about influences of eugenics
on psychology and society. As a part of this, I’m reading Robert A.
Wilson’s, “The Eugenic Mind Project” <span class="citation">(Press
n.d.)</span>. I’ll use this page to write notes about what I’m
reading.</p>
<p>Wilson has circuitous path to writing this book. He’s an Australian,
has worked in US and Canada, now back in Melbourne. While in Edmonton,
Alberta, he developed an interest in western Canadian eugenics and
working with survivors of forced sterilization. He also was the project
director for the <a href="http://eugenicsarchive.ca" class="external-link">Eugenics
Archives</a>, which is a herculean effort by many people to create an
online repository of knowledge around eugenics in Canada and the
world.</p>

<h3 id="standpointing-eugenics">1 Standpointing Eugenics<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#standpointing-eugenics"></a>
</h3>
<p>I’m only on pg. 2, but had to start writing. I’m not a social
scientist, so have much to learn about theory and practice in that
domain. Concurrently with researching eugenics I am also <a href="https://crumplab.github.io/blogposts/7_2_20_JBP/7_2_20_JBP.html" class="external-link">reading
through the Journal of Black Psychology</a>. In this other avenue of
reading, I am finding that I am overwhelmingly impoverished as a white
male in understanding many Black issues. I have no lived experience as a
Black person, how could I understand? I mention this because it connects
to standpoint theory. I’d never heard of standpoint epistemology before,
and Wilson summarizes it as, “standpoint theory emphasizes the positive
value that thinking about knowledge and value from certain kinds of
marginalized standpoint can have”. The take home for me is that “lived
experience” brings something valuable the table. I dig that very much.
So, Wilson says he will present a standpoint eugenics, or at least a
standpoint-ish eugenics.</p>
<p>Wilson’s eugenics in a nutshell, “Eugenics arose in the nineteenth
century both as a proposed, meliorative science–a science of human
improvement or betterment– and as a social movement…distinctive aim to
use science/tech to regulate the sorts of people there would be in
future generations”. This is fairly neutral language for what was/is an
aggressively racist and classist movement that has committed atrocities
all around the world.</p>
<p>pg. 9, James Watson appointed to director of the Office of Human
Genome Research 1988…Watson was director of Cold Spring Harbor
Laboratory since 1968, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugenics_Record_Office" class="external-link">previously
the Eugenics Record Office</a>, and has expressed several pro-eugenics
views after leaving the directorship.</p>
<p>pg. 10, early 2000s 4/33 states that passed sterilization laws made
apologies, following legal settlements in Alberta between survivors and
the province that sterilized them</p>
<p>pg. 11 “…view of eugenics as simply a regrettable past…” this seems
like a common and very unfortunate view of eugenics that needs to
change. Especially given the “recent revelations of ongoing
sterilizations in Australia, California, and India…”</p>
<p>pg. 11– Eugenics survivor Leilani Muir and her legal battle against
Alberta…classified as a “moron” as child <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_H._Goddard" class="external-link">see
Psychologist/Eugenicist Henry Goddard’s and his IQ advocacy</a>.</p>
<p>TODO: need to flesh out what I will call the “moron hysteria” created
by IQ testing and Goddard among others. Goddard argued for classifying
“feeble-minded” people into classes by IQ, e.g., idiots ~ 20, Imbeciles
~ 40, Morons ~ 70, see Goddard’s “Who is a Moron?” <span class="citation">Goddard (1927)</span>. The fear was that morons are
basically normal competent people who are able to hide in society, but
they will also destroy the human race if they are allowed to breed. The
only way to discover morons was to IQ test them, and then employ
eugenics polices to prevent morons from breeding.</p>
<p>pg. 13 – Institutional complicity…guess who was the founding chair of
the U of Alberta’s Philosophy Department? Prof. John MacEachran, the
original head of Alberta’s Eugenics Board. He was the longest serving
department chair…continued to approve sterilizations until he was 88
(eugenics board in Alberta repealed in 1972).</p>
<p>I’m pretty sure that Psychology as a discipline has not grappled
with, understood, apologized for, and repaired it’s own institutional
complicity in eugenics. I mean 31 of the first many APA president’s were
eugenics leaders <span class="citation">(Yakushko 2019)</span>.</p>
<p>pg. 15-16. Wow, boning up on my recent Albertan history that happened
while I lived there. Premier Ralph Klein tried to use the
notwithstanding clause to limit any settlements made to eugenics
survivors for any reason. This legislation was withdrawn in 24 hours
because of public backlash.</p>
<p>pg. 16 - interesting, U of A phil dept. makes a small committee in
1998 “the MacEachran Sub-Committee”, that displayed the history, and
made recommendations (e.g., take down MacEachran’s name, don’t use his
him for honorifics, ensure teaching of eugenics in courses)</p>

</h3>
<p>A brief history of eugenics, as well considering how to grapple with
the past and presentness of eugenics in society. The eugenic mind is
partly an attempt to elucidate the ideology and thinking that motivates
and sustains eugenicists</p>
<p>Galton…key components of eugenic thought Eugenics as Applied science
.. Pearson, Fisher</p>
<p>“The ugly us-versus-them racial and ethnic divisiveness that depicts
an inferior Eugenic Other as the deep root of contemporary social
problems is just its most obvious manifestation”.</p>
<p>pg 34 eugenics as a social movement, “a fervent social movement, one
championed by many community leaders– from politicians, to university
presidents and provosts, from farmers to members of elite and learned
societies, from radical progressives to political conservatives”. Also
became widespread around the world, with a very active national/local
organizations</p>
<p>TODO: Look up “The Oxford Handbook of the History of Eugenics” for a
geographically inclusive range of national contexts for eugenics
movements <span class="citation">(<em>The <span>Oxford Handbook</span>
of the <span>History</span> of <span>Eugenics</span></em>
2010)</span></p>
<p>Eugenics should be studied “in” and “and” dimensions…In specific
local places and regions (e.g., western Canada), and related to other
social phenomena, e.g., eugenics and genetics, sexuality, race, etc.
Clearly, AND psychology.</p>
<p>pg. 36. Eugenics, Race and ethnocentrism</p>
<p>Fear of immigrants, reducing immigration, eugenics polices…Racial
Hygiene societies, forced assimilation (Canadian residential
schools)</p>
<p>40– Mental abilities, feeble-mindedness, Psycho-eugenics.</p>
<p>Galton’s obsessions with mental ability as the highest order thing to
breed for</p>
<p>Institutionalization of “feeble-minded” people The threat of
“feeble-minded” people…responsible for all societies ills</p>
<p>The short history and long past…Where the “long past” is used to
build a noble vision of eugenics.</p>
<p>Takeaways…Eugenics is a very multitudinous thing that is difficult to
characterize. It is much more than a relic of the past. This chapter
emphasizes the need to invoke something like a contemporary
understanding of the eugenic mind past and present, because the long
past is still happening.</p>

</h3>
<p>As I read this I am wondering whether Wilson will go into the role of
differential psychologists in developing tools to measure these
traits.</p>
<p>Eugenic traits are the ones that eugenicists ostensibly want to
select for in their breeding programs. Eugenicists identify some of
these traits by writing about them in numerous publications.</p>
<p>pg. 54, getting into the ERO (Eugenic Records Office at cold springs,
on long island, NY). One task they were doing was collecting
genealogical studies, to map out which people had good traits etc. It is
eye-opening to read “biographies” in the Eugenical News, where they
amazing traits of specific individuals are fawned over.</p>
<p>Charles Davenport (director of ERO) had an alphabet map that
standardizes eugenic traits (in this case negative one), for tracing and
elimination purposes.</p>
<p><img src="img/ERO.png" width="545"></p>
<p>Here is an example genealogical survey using the letters to identify
“degeneracy” throughout the family.</p>
<p><img src="img/ERO2.png" width="379"></p>
<p>By 1939, the ERO had made ~ one million index cards tracing lineages
using the above methodology. ERO in general gives an idea of eugenic
traits in practice.</p>

<p>“Question here is not about one about the extremes of eugenics, but
about the routinized, normalized forms that eugenics subsequently took.”

</h2>
<p>Still letting the book simmer, I will come back here after a few days
and collect some more thoughts. For now, I’m very glad to have read
this. There was some personal moments in that I was raised in Northern
Alberta, and I can’t remember ever learning about forced sterilization
in Alberta, or the roots of eugenics throughout the province and Canada
in general.</p>
<p>I didn’t really know what to expect from this book, all I knew was
the Wilson was the project director for the <a href="http://eugenicsarchive.ca" class="external-link">Eugenics Archives</a>, and that was
such a great website, how could I not read this book.</p>
<p>This is a multi-faceted composition, ranging from a historical
treatment of eugenics in the Albertan context, to the construction of
arguments about how to have knowledge about eugenics in the past and the
present. In the latter effort, Wilson is deeply into the academic side
of the social sciences, but is nevertheless approachable. The social
science side of things along with moral philosophy and bioethics are
heady topics, I have much to learn in that regard.</p>
<p>Some immediate takeaways that threaded through my entire reading.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Standpoint eugenics. Wilson develops and advocates for a
standpoint eugenics; and, in the process he asks what exactly that
should entail. He argues that people in the margins, survivors of
eugenics, have unique knowledge bearing on eugenics issues that are
necessary to understand the eugenic mind. He positions standpoint
eugenics within philosophical questions about knowledge. For example,
who can know what? If there are standpoints, whose should be
used?</p></li>
<li><p>The “eugenic mind”. I found this phrase confusing throughout,
perhaps it was purposely ambiguous. What does it refer to? It could
refer to the kind of mind that eugenicists sought to breed through
eugenics policies. In some sense it does. But, I think Wilson is talking
more about the project to understand the mindset of eugenics, both
within an individual and society. What the mindset entails, and how
pervasive it is. Wilson deconstructs the notion that eugenics is a relic
of the past, so the “eugenic mind” is very much alive today, and society
would do well to recognize and counteract this way of thinking and
behaving.</p></li>
<li><p>Institutional complicity: This is one of the topics I am most
interested in with respect to the relationship between eugenics and
psychology. Wilson does not probe the depths of the eugenic/psychology
combo, which I will call structural eugenics in Psychology. My sense is
that the institutions of Psychology are complicit in numerous ways that
should be identified and repaired. Perhaps even following somewhat the
example set by the U of Alberta philosophy department.</p></li>
</ol>
