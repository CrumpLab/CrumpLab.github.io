How do people learn patterns and regularities in their environment? These kinds of questions are investigated using behavioral experiments and computational modeling of cognitive processes. The lab also uses a variety of computational methods and tools to conduct and communicate research.\nCurrent and previous lab members include undergraduate, master’s , doctoral, and postdoctoral researcher associates. If you are interested in human cognition and using computational techniques for theorizing, running experiments, analyzing data, and developing new technologies then you may be interested in joining the team.\nThe lab is located in the Department of Psychology at Brooklyn College of CUNY, and affiliated with the Cognitive and Comparative Psychology Training area of the Psychology Doctoral program at the Graduate Center of CUNY."

But, I noted that it is possible to upgrade and downgrade, so if I wanted to invite more people to my little bbs experiment I could do that. Or, if you are setting this up for a group, it seems pretty easy to grow larger (at least up to 2000 users for 89/month).\n\n\n\nAfter clicking “buy now” there is a decision to use your own domain or subdomain, or a masto.host subdomain.\n\n\nA quick aside for domain names. I have been using R Markdown and more recently Quarto for lots of purposes, including creating this website and blog. All of the source code for compiling this website and blog is in a github repository, and served from github pages. At some point I used namecheap to acquire my domain crumplab.com. This allowed me to serve my website from that domain (there is an option to use your own domain on github pages).\nIn addition, it is possible to add subdomains. For example, I have a jatos server running on digital ocean for online experiments, which has it’s own subdomain on crumplab.com.\nFor mastodon I chose “Your domain”, and came up with the subdomain bbs.crumplab.com as a throwback to the bulletin board services I used to use as a kid.\n\nI don’t have screen shots for some of the next steps, but basically you enter your credit card information. In my case, immediately after purchasing I got a warning from mastodon that bbs.crumplab.com was not found on my DNS servers. Masto.host kindly gives clear instructions on what I needed to do in order to add my subdomain, which involved adding a new cname entry, and waiting for it to propagate.\nAfter masto.host detected my subdomain, it automagically created a new mastodon instance.\n\n\nAnd, when installation was finished it updated to let me know. This all took about 15 minutes from start to finish, and most of the time was waiting for DNS issues to be resolved."

For example, if I had the intention of creating an instance that other people could join, the process would be similarly easy, but I expect the realities of doing admin and moderation require a much larger time investment. I don’t have the bandwidth to think about running a larger instance right now, so I’m going to stick to learning the system in this person-sized instance.\n\nAll by myself\nSo far the experience of being “alone” on my own instance is A OK. The default feeds work a little bit differently. My “local” feed is the same as my personal timeline, because no one else is on the instance. My home feed I guess is the same as it would be if I was on a shared instance. I see posts from the people I follow, and I see the things they are boosting. I’m not sure I totally understand what I am seeing on the federated feed, but it appears to be the people I follow, but not what they are boosting. It’s not a fire-hose of posts.\nI still don’t know how to add things to lists.\nAttempting to “micro-blog” with a personal mastodon instance has been rewarding so far, especially to prompt thinking about how I engage with social media in general, and how I curate/save/share what I’m doing. Everything I post on the instance is there, I guess for me to deal with and make decisions about.\nThere is a great deal of topic worth engaging on, and I’m hoping this process can help me navigate my own engagement."

    "text": "Last knit: 2022-11-10\nDecided to make fonts, and I’m using this post to find out if the fonts can be displayed on the web (the answer is yes.)\nSo far I have tried two different workflows using ifontmaker and calligraphr. Both approaches work pretty well.\nifontmaker is an ipad app ($7.99). For the price it has some nice features, and it is pretty easy to pencil in all of the character very quickly. It has bezier curves, but the brushes are limited. It is possible to copy in .svg. I liked the kerning feature for letter pairs.\ncalligraphr is a website providing a template to draw characters. I open the template in procreate or adobe fresco and do the characters there. Then, the template is uploaded to calligraphr.com, which converts the font to .otf or .ttf.\nI used https://transfonter.org to convert .ttf to .woff. This should allow the font to be displayed on the web. Let’s find out.\nSidenote: this post is written in R markdown and compiled as a vignette with pkgdown. I add a “web” folder in the vignette folder where I saved the .woff files for the font. These files can be saved to the docs folder if they are declared in the yaml as resource files https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/reference/build_articles.html#external-files.\nMy plan for this paragraph is to write the first letter in squiggligraphy, and all of the rest of the letters in the default font for this post. The rest of this text is just filler text to make this paragraph look like a paragraph. It should have enough words for a few sentences. At least a few. Or, more than a few. Enough for a paragraph.\nNeat. The capital letters from squiggligraphy were not vertically aligned properly, so I had to adjust them in font forge, an open source font editor. I also used font forge to export as .woff and .woff2 for the web.\nTo add the the capital letter i’m using a span, choosing h1 class (from bootstrap 5), and a custom class that sets the font family. It’s a bit clunky but it gets the letter capitalized in a custom font."

For example, RefManageR can do something like this, but it doesn’t support .csl, so the output may not be in the style you want (and it doesn’t output to APA).\nHere’s a quick example of print_refs() in action.\n\nlibrary(bib2df)\nlibrary(stevemisc)\nlibrary(stringi)\n\n# load a bib file to data frame\nbib_df <- bib2df(file=\"Crump.bib\")\n\n# clean entries\nbib_df$TITLE <- stri_replace_all_regex(bib_df$TITLE, \"[\\\\{\\\\}]\", \"\")\nbib_df$JOURNAL <- stri_replace_all_regex(bib_df$JOURNAL, \"[\\\\{\\\\}]\", \"\")\nbib_df$BOOKTITLE <- stri_replace_all_regex(bib_df$BOOKTITLE, \"[\\\\{\\\\}]\", \"\")\n\n# convert a single row back to .bib entry\nbib_entry <- paste0(capture.output(df2bib(bib_df[1,])), collapse=\"\")\nbib_entry\n#> [1] \"@Article{allanPsychophysicsContingencyAssessment2008,  Author = {Allan, Lorraine G. and Hannah, Samuel D. and Crump, Matthew J.

J. C. Crump, S. D. Hannah, L. G. Allan, \\\\& L. K. Hord, 2007). In the present experiments, they used the streamed-trial procedure, combined with the method of constant stimuli and a binary classification response, to assess the psychophysics of contingency assessment. This strategy provides a methodology for evaluating whether variations in contingency assessment reflect changes in the participant’s sensitivity to the contingency or changes in the participant’s response bias (or decision criterion). The sign of the contingency (positive or negative), outcome density, and imposition of an explicit payoff structure had little influence on sensitivity to contingencies but did influence the decision criterion. The authors discuss how a psychophysical analysis can provide a better understanding of findings in the literature such as mood and age effects on contingency assessment. They also discuss the relation between a psychophysical approach and an associative account of contingency assessment.},  File = {/Users/mattcrump/Zotero/storage/AMVABHNJ/Allan et al. - 2008 - The psychophysics of contingency assessment..pdf}}\"\n\n# print out the citation\nstevemisc::print_refs(bib_entry,\n                      csl = \"apa.csl\",\n                      spit_out = TRUE,\n                      delete_after = FALSE)\n#> Allan, L.

    "text": "A bit of background\n\n\n\n\n\nThis spring 2022, I taught an introductory survey course on cognitive psychology. I’ve been at Brooklyn College for over a decade and haven’t taught my core area very often. Since summer 2021, I’ve been making up for lost time and decided to develop a suite of open educational resources for introductory cognition. I ran the course for the first time last semester. The modality was synchronous online, so students joined me every week for class lectures. I intended to have a textbook chapter for each week of the course, but I didn’t get that far in writing the textbook (note to self, that I need to finish the book).\nIn any case, the format for fall 2021 was fairly standard. I had weekly multiple choice quizzes that I posted on blackboard. I had two midterms and final exam. I gave students a few ways to get extra credit. And, I offered some optional writing assignments for students that wanted to dig into the material a little bit more.\nThe class went off the rails in the middle of the semester. That’s a story for another day, but let’s say an extraordinary amount of unapproved student collaboration occurred. I also learned that I would be teaching the same course in spring 2022 in an asynchronous online format. I knew I wanted to create more interesting assignments for the asynchronous version of the course. So, I made up a bunch of assignments and tested some of them on fall cohort as a second chance to make up for points they may have lost."

Ultimately, this involved creating a ton of content, which took a huge amount of effort. I put all of that content into “learning modules” for each week of the course. All of the learning modules are on the course website, and freely available as an open educational resource.\nI structured each learning module into three sections: Read, Watch/Listen, and Engage. The reading section usually linked to a textbook chapter, or any additional readings I wanted to assign. The watch/listen section contained mini-lectures that I recorded and posted YouTube (this part took so much time every week). The engage section contained quizzes and assignments that students could complete each week.\nNow comes the fun part, here’s how I flooded the gates with assignment choice to increase engagement with the course material."

    "text": "Multiple Warp Zones to an A\n\n\n\n\n\nGiven the asynchronous format, I wanted to give students every opportunity to do well in the course. I also wanted to dream up as many ways as I could think of to offer students meaningful ways to engage with the course material. Here’s what I did.\nThere were 12 learning modules and three exams. The grading rubric is below:\n\n\n\nAssignment\nPoints\nTotal\n\n\n\n\n12 Weekly Modules\n5+\nup to 60\n\n\nExtra Credit\nsee above rules\nup to 10*\n\n\nSUPER BONUS\nsee above rules\nup to 40*\n\n\nMidterm 1\n13.33\n13.33\n\n\nMidterm 2\n13.33\n13.33\n\n\nFinal Exam\n13.33\n13.33\n\n\n\n\n100\n\n\n\nThere were three equally weighted exams, making up 40/100 points. The remaining 60/100 points came from any other assignment in the course.\n\nwarp zone 1: Ace the quizzes and exams\n\n\n\n\n\nEach learning module had a quiz worth 5 points and there were 12 learning modules. So, a student could get 100% on all the quizzes for \\(12*5 = 60\\) points. If they also aced the exams, then they could get 100/100 for a perfect A+ score.\nI view this as the standard fare option for getting through an intro survey course (i.e., pass the quizzes and exams). I think many students are familiar with this structure and some may even prefer it over a course with other kinds of assignments and assessment.\nStudents always want to know how they will be tested, so I told them that the quizzes they take each week will prepare them for the tests. The exam questions would be like the quiz questions, and some of the quiz questions might even reappear on the exams. I also let them do each quiz twice and allowed them to take the highest grade. It took a really long time to write pools of questions for every quiz and exam. A really long soul-sucking time. And, now I have a respectable test bank for the course (I wrote it using R/exams, which lets me export to Blackboard and pdf, it’s nifty).\nBut, I don’t think taking a bunch of quizzes and exams about cognition is particularly engaging. Also, I’m the one who wrote all of the questions, and even though I tried really hard to write good questions, I’m not 100% confident that my tests are good tests of what I’m trying to teach. So, it’s not clear how much test grades reflect student performance versus my performance as an instructor. Plus, my whole philosophy on testing is migrating, so I was looking to add more flare.\nI usually require writing in all of my courses, no matter how many students I have. This could be viewed as a form of masochism. For example, I don’t have a TA for my class of 125+ students, and many instructors in my position might not assign writing assignments because they would be overwhelmed by grading.\nAssigning multiple weekly writing assignments for a class that size could be viewed as a form of self-torture, and an over-bearing workload for students.\nBut, I did it anyway\n\n\nwarp zone 2: Everything is optional\n\n\n\n\n\nAs a reminder, students could get up to 60 points from quizzes. The rest of the points came from exams. The second warp zone was to create an alternate way of making up the 60 points. This would give students some choice in how they engaged in course material.\nStudents already had the choice of taking one quiz per week, and they could get all 60 points that way. To increase choice, I added one or two alternative writing assignments to each learning module. This part was way more fun for me in terms of generating what I considered interesting ways to engage in course material.\nFor examples, I made short writing assignments on how to read a primary research article, mental imagery, the APA’s apology to people of color, and many more.\nEach writing assignment was 5 points, just like a quiz. So, each week students could take a quiz, complete a writing assignment, or both.\nI managed the grading by making the assignments short (typically, 100-300 words). I did the grading mostly pass/fail, and students either got full points or not (if they submitted stuff that was way off base). It wasn’t possible to give in-depth feedback on each assignment because of the number of students, but it was possible to give group level feedback.\nNot all of my students routinely did the writing assignments, but when they did them, they were really engaged as measured by how awesome their submissions were.\nIn addition to writing assignments for each learning module, I added on more and more optional assignments. For example, one assignment was to detect and report issues in the textbook I’ve been writing. Perhaps, this was ploy to get students to read the textbook… I also added points for participating in discussion boards, and added more general writing assignments that students could complete by the end of the semester (rather than by the due dates set at the end of each week).\n\n\nWarp zone 3: Extra credit\n\n\n\n\n\nvia GIPHY\n\nAt this point, students can get to 60 points by completing any combination of quizzes or assignments. That’s great. But, they still have to take these three exams for 40 points. And, students always want to know if there are extra credit options.\nLucky for them, I love extra credit. I made two tiers of extra credit. If students got to 60 points by completing quizzes and assignments, then any points over 60 was converted to extra credit. The conversion rule was 5 regular points to 1 extra credit. And, I allowed up to 10 extra credits. So, students could complete 10 additional 5 point assignments and get 10 points added onto their final score for the course. That’s a good dose of extra credit, and can make up for a bad showing on a midterm or final.\nI love extra credit so much, that in the middle of the semester I made an addendum to the syllabus to describe a super bonus level of extra credit. If students actually did so many optional assignments that they got to the max of 10 extra credits, then I basically made the extra credit rain.\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the super bonus level mark I changed the conversion ratio from 5 to 1, to 2.5 to 1, which doubled the amount of extra from 10 points to 20 points; and, I raised the max extra credit to 40 points, which covers the points students needed to receive from exams.\nThis is just a fancy way of saying that students could get an A without passing the exams. They would have to pass lots of optional assignments, but IMO, the assignments I created were much more interesting and deserving of an A than the exams."

You can change the title of the blog in “index.qmd”, and add more info to the about page by writing new text in “about.qmd”. But, let’s focus on making a new post.\nFirst, navigate into the “posts” folder. The template contains two existing posts. Each post is in its own folder.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo make a new post, you can “copy” an existing folder for a post and give it a new name.\n\n\n\n\n\nI named my new post “my-new-post”, and now I can see it listed as a folder beside the original two from the template.\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s click into the folder and edit the “index.qmd” file. Here are the files inside the folder:\n\n\n\n\n\nClicking on “index.qmd” should open the file in the R studio text editor (on the left):\n\n\n\n\n\nI edited this file and gave it a new title, new author, etc. Then I deleted the text at the bottom and wrote my own first blog post.\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, if I render the website again (from the build tab), my new post is automatically added to the list of posts (they are listed in order by date).\n\n\n\n\n\nYou could now be off to the races. To further customize, delete the template posts you don’t want and replace them with your own. At this point your blog is only on your local computer. If you want to share it on the internet, then follow the next steps to share your blog using Github.com."

The steps might appear complicated, but it’s not too bad once you get everything set up.\n\nOpen up Github Desktop\nGo to preferences and sign in to your Github.com account\n“Add” your blog project folder to Github Desktop\nPublish to github.com and uncheck private repository (if you want other people to see it.)\nYou should now be able to see your new repository in your github.com profile, which means you should be able to see a copy of your blog files in the repository.\n\nI’ve been leaving out some of the technical details. Briefly, in this blogging workflow you write your blog in a “.qmd” document, which stands for “quarto” markdown. This is a plain text file. When you “render the website”, the quarto engine creates the necessary html and other web-files needed to display your blog. By default all of these web-files are stored in the “_site” folder.\nIn the last step, we are going to change where the files are saved from “_site” to a new folder named “docs”. This is because Github.com can conveniently serve files located in “docs” folders as websites.\nTo change the output directory from _site to docs open up _quarto.yml, and add the line output-dir: docs just like this:\nproject:\n  type: website\n  output-dir: docs\nWhen you render the website again, you should see a new docs folder with your blog files.\nPush your changes to github so that your repository, and activate the github pages option under your repository settings. Then you should be able to view your blog live from the URL given by github pages."

The story picked up more attention than I anticipated. I shared the story as part of a course assessment writing exercise, which has now been completed, and the original post is no longer available.\nPart of my course assessment exercise was to learn more about the literature on cheating behavior. I conducted a short literature review on that topic and am posting brief notes about a few of the papers.\nFor teaching psychology, I found this paper to be most relevant and current:\nJenkins, B.

The main findings were: (a) the inci dence of cheating among these graduate subjects was found to be at least as extensive as reported in prior studies among undergraduate students?at least eighteen of the forty-five (40%) graduate subjects cheated on the quizzes; (b) pressure to obtain good grades was the main reason subjects felt they cheated in the past; (c) there was a lack of consensus whether certain behaviors constitute cheating; (d) no significant personality differences were found between cheaters and non-cheaters; (e) the MMPI results provided evidence in support of the doctrine of specificity of moral behavior.\n\nBaird Jr, J.

A questionnnaire measuring 7 subject variables and 33 specific behaviors was administered to 200 students. The finding that about 75% of those surveyed had cheated in college was interpreted as supporting an hypothesized trend toward increasing dishonesty. Data on approval and guilt, reasons for cheating, reactions to cheating, and specific techniques were included. It was found that sex, year in shcool, grade point average, academic major, fraternity-sorority membership, and extracurricular participation were significantly related to cheating. The conclusions supported the importance of traditional explanatory variables and suggested an interpretation based on attribution theory.\n\nNuss, E. M. (1984).

This research demonstrates that cheating is prevalent and that some forms of cheating have increased dramatically in the last 30 years. This research also suggests that although both individual and contextual factors influence cheating, contextual factors, such as students’ perceptions of peers’ behavior, are the most powerful influence. In addition, an institution’s academic integrity programs and policies, such as honor codes, can have a significant influence on students’ behavior. Finally, we offer suggestions for managing cheating from students’ and faculty members’ perspectives.\nTable 1 shows Self-Admitted Cheating—Summary Statistics which range from 44 to 82%.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBowers, W.

My research area is cognition; however, over the past decade I have mostly not taught cognition courses, especially at the undergraduate level where I taught lots of stats and research methods. Last year was the first time I got to teach an intro to cognition course two semesters in a row! Looks like I’m on a roll because I get to teach it again this semester. Additionally, I’m teaching cognition modules for separate doctoral and masters programs, so Fall 2022 is a whole lotta cognition going on.\nTLDR: I’m going to try ungrading my course this semester.

    "text": "Eugenics and the white-washing of psychology\nI started learning more about the social, historical, and political aspects of psychology that were not incorporated into the curriculum that I was trained on. Past me didn’t realize how much of psychology was deeply rooted in eugenics and related systems of oppression. IMO, many of the roots remain buried and not widely discussed in psychology curricula. Sadly, some of the roots are still around. Learning about eugenics/psychology connections has impacted both my research and teaching outlook. In short, when considering how to approach a research or teaching project I have a voice asking “what would a eugenicist do?”, and then, just like Meatloaf, “I won’t do that.”\nThis summer I embarked on a long eugenics and society in general reading project. My reading list is here. All of that reading built up a strong anti-eugenics mood.\nSome highlights very much worth the read for psychologists are Yakushko (2019), and Guthrie (2004). Yakushko’s “Scientific Pollyannaism” covers a wide range of disappointing and deeply problematic aspects of early to modern psychology. Guthrie’s “Even the Rat was white” should have been the default textbook on the history of psychology since it was first published in 1976.\nI have already incorporated aspects of these topics into the content of my cognition course (e.g., chapters on eugenics and IQ testing). But, I have not yet really changed the structure of the course in a way that aims to deconstruct eugenics influences in the classroom. For example, I’m not interested in churning my students through testing and ranking processes inspired by eugenicists. I’d rather participate with my students in a process of engaging in the course material."

    "text": "Academic integrity\nAt the end of May I wrote a blog post about some widespread cheating behavior that occurred in my cognition class in Fall 2021. I wrote that post as a part of a teaching assessment process and to reflect on how to do better next time. My undergrad cognition course is going into its third revision. I first taught it synchronous online (gave zoom lectures etc.), and then in Spring 2022 I taught in an asynchronous format (recorded lots of YouTube videos). A few months ago I also wrote a post about how I structured the asynchronous course with a buffet of assignment options for students, so they had many ways to get a grade they wanted to achieve. I think the second version of the course with lots of assignment choice was much better for student engagement, and fortunately I didn’t have to deal with any academic integrity issues.\nI’m intending to roll over the successes from the second version into my in-person course this fall, especially all of options for assignment choice.\nI’d also like to avoid major academic integrity issues. One of the outcomes of having a class where most students violated academic integrity principles was that I took a quick dive into the literature on cheating behavior in university. If you teach psychology and are interested in whether your students are cheating or not, I’d recommend reading Jenkins et al. (2022) who estimate that about 75% of students self-report cheating in psych classes. It’s a concern. There’s so many ways to cheat these days, such as paying someone else (contract cheating) to take your course for you or do your assignments (Hollis 2018). Or, getting an AI like GPT-3 to do your writing assignments.\nI’d like to run a course where students would rather engage in the material than violate academic integrity issues."

We suggested that many courses are 14 weeks long and involve lectures, reading textbooks, midterms and exams, maybe a written paper or two. Students thought that the final exam could be worth anywhere between 5% to 50% of their grade. I asked, “If you could delete one thing from a standard course, what would it be?” The overwhelming answer was to get rid of written papers, and the second most popular was to get rid of exams. To introduce how ungrading would work in this course, I told students I would delete one thing and then I used my dry-erase marker to cross out all of the exams in the course. Then we spent the rest of the first class going over expectations about the course and fielding questions about how ungrading would work.\nThis is my first time ungrading, and I’ll modify things as necessary across the course. I decided to keep close to the course structure I adopted last time. The previous structure involved weekly learning modules, lots of optional assignments to choose from to gain points toward a grade (5 points each), and midterms and a final exam. I’m scrapping the midterms and final exams, and replacing them with self-assessments for goal-setting, goal refinement, and goal evaluation. But, I am keeping all of the optional assignments and adding more. I’m also keeping the points system, but students will be responsible for self-assessing their work and recommending their own points for each assignment. All of the learning modules and assignments are posted on the LMS (Blackboard), and that system can be useful for students to keep track of what they have done or need to do next in the course."

The contents of the portfolio are various: including an attendance record, participation in class online and offline, and all of the written and creative work completed over the semester. The course offers many weekly (and alternative timeframe) assignments that students can complete to engage with learning and add to their portfolio.\nI have planned for three assessments throughout the course. These replace exams that I would normally administer during those class periods. The purpose of the assessments is to support students in creating and meeting learning goals. I’m having the first assessment on the third class of the semester, the second assessment is in the middle of the semester, and the last assessment will occur during the final examination period. The first assessment will be about setting goals for the course. The second assessment will be a mid-semester “self-directed performance review” to check-in with their goals and make course corrections if necessary. The final assessment will be a retrospective and explanation about the portfolio they created across the course. I’m also planning to share the assessment forms with the class weeks in advance so that we can collaboratively edit the questions to make them more useful.\nWith all of this said, I need to draft a first assessment.

One thing is for sure, I don’t have time to use Adobe Express to make a header for this blog post. Moving forward, I think I would like the option to have some #rstats generative art code do that for me. That way I can rip into the writing faster.\nAbout a week ago I tried Mastodon. It feels longer ago. I went from joining an instance, to learning about the fediverse, activitypub, and more, to spinning up my own instance using masto.host. So, crumplab.com got a new subdomain: https://bbs.crumplab.com\nAs of right now this instance is closed to new accounts. But, it is possible to view the local feed, showing posts made by accounts inside the instance: bbs.crumplab.com/public. In general, the local feeds of other instances can be viewed in the same way (provided the instance admins approve the option).\nWhen I get time to keep my skill set up to date, I dive in, so I’m happy I happened to have a bit of time to get started with the fediverse. I’m pretty sure all of these tools will become useful for my research and teaching, as well as my students. And, I need to become semi-proficient in the tool set before it becomes usable in the lab and classroom, so I got busy learning the ropes of administering a mastodon instance, as well as operating an account. Much more important was observing and listening to the existing communities on mastodon, for tips and conventions for engaging with the fediverse. I’m very happy to meet such a wide array of engaged people who are stewards of the digital community. It’s been fun watching the migration and learn from others. For example, Danielle Navarro has shared a super helpful overview https://blog.djnavarro.net/posts/2022-11-03_what-i-know-about-mastodon/.

The main hassle I’m dealing with as an admin is blocking other instances (see this helpful list if you are looking to block instances: https://github.com/chaossocial/about/blob/master/blocked_instances.md)\nI did not have time to learn how to use the mastodon API, which is very-well documented; so, I was unable to automate the process of blocking instances.

For example, I log in to all of my accounts AND I log in at the server level. This way I can browse my federated timeline and respond from any account. It works really well.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Last knit: 2022-11-10\nI’ll probably spend more time on making the banner image for this post than writing it because there’s a looming Brooklyn brunch situation, and I only have a simple suggestion for my future self: unplan your course.\nI’ve planned lots of courses, and I’m about to plan two more for next semester. One of them is a Macaulay Honor’s seminar for undergraduates in the first year of that program. The seminar is called, “The people of New York City”. It’s a really interesting course that has been taught in many different ways across CUNY. It’s also way outside my realm of expertise, which is typical for everyone who is asked to lead this seminar. Needless to say, I have started planning my approach to the seminar. But, I really don’t want the planning to get in the way, so I’m starting to do unplanning as well.\nWhat does unplanning entail? I’m not so sure yet, so I’m slopping down thoughts about what I might mean. Relatedly, this Fall 2022 semester I am trying “ungrading” (Blum 2020) in my intro to cognition course. This approach can mean lots of different things for a classroom, and I’ve been blogging a bit about that over here. One of the things it means to me is that the class becomes a community space inhabited by participating individual learners. From this vantage point, I’ve been working through what it means to deliver my planned course as a member of the community who is very quickly coming up to speed with community wants and needs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBrunch\n\n\n\nBlogging interrupted by a hamburger\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd, I picked up some new records on the walk home, so I get to finish this with some musical inspiration.\n\n\nIn the cognition course I’ve got the planning side of things down. That is, for any class I have lots of pre-planned content and activities that could be done. What I’m becoming more interested in is whether any of the things I planned should be done, especially considering the other possibilities for learning that can be identified together with the rest of the class. Those other possibilities don’t exist before the class, they come into existence with the class. Too much advance planning can easily sideline a class from self-determining their learning process. So, I’m rolling around the term unplanning to make sure I remember not to over plan, and/or to plan for how a community of learners will set, accomplish, and assess their own learning process.\nTo provide a more specific example, I’ll go back to the honor’s seminar course I’m prepping. There will be about 20 first year students in the class. The course topic is stated as “the people of New York City”, and there are lots of ways to learn about the people of NYC across time and place. The topic is easily way too big for a course. One approach I will take as a course leader is to consider how different research methods might be applied to learning about complex topics such as the people of NYC. This fits with another general course goal of exposing students to research methods and digital means of conducting and communicating research. For example, the Macaulay program encourages students to create blogs and websites, and many previous classes have turned their research products into websites as an end-of-semester project.\nPart of my course planning right now involves creating the course website. I’m using quarto to do this (which is the same process I use for this blog and website), and I’m planning to teach my students how to make their own quarto blogs and websites. These will be used throughout the course as a venue to create and share research about the people of NYC.\nWhere does unplanning fit into this? Right now I’m planning to design most elements of a course as I normally would do. I’ll write the whole syllabus and detail out what I expect will happen for each class time, along with readings and assignments. But, I’ll be looking for places where I think it would be more beneficial for the class to fill in the blanks than it would be for me to fill them in.\nFor example, in this class we will likely be completing a mini-project every two weeks or so. Each mini-project will explore using a research method to ask and answer questions about the people of NYC. This structure invites all sorts of questions about motivation for the research: what kinds of questions are worth asking, what kinds of answers are worth knowing about, what kinds of stories are we looking to learn about, what kinds of stories will we tell? I have opinions about all of these things, and I could find readings or draft material to inform my students about these opinions. At the same time, I can unplan this part. For example, I would be much more interested in having the class grapple with issues of motivation, and have them explicate and contexualize their motivations as a part of communicating their projects.\nIn this example, I’d like the class to produce material about their motivations for their research and put it on their website. Or, the whole group can collaborate on statements and content for the course website that reflect the process of self-direction for our learning community.\nUnplanning could be me defining sample question-mark spaces that need filling. Overplanning is me filling the space. Unplanning could be “empty” pages on the course website pointing at issues that need to be addressed by the class before the end of the semester. Answering the question marks, or making new ones and answering them, can be part of the mechanism catalyzing the community to engage with itself and motivate how it steps through a learning process.\nSomehow I accidentally slipped into blogging on a Sunday, and it’s time to go turn over a record.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nBlum, Susan Debra. 2020.

    "text": "One of my ongoing projects is an open-educational resource for a survey course in cognitive psychology. The project currently includes a textbook, course website, slides, and assignment suggestions under a creative commons license (CC-BY-SA 4.0). The textbook has nine chapters, and at some point I plan to add a few more. As it stands, when I teach this course, we transition from textbook readings toward reading primary research articles. To supplement and encourage more reading of primary research, I’m considering adding a suggested reading list section to the textbook. The purpose of this blog post is to draft some reading lists, and think about how I would curate and present them.\nI think I have two general problems to solve:\nIdeally, I think I want a zotero folder with sub-folders for different topics in cognition, each full of recommended papers to read. I already use zotero, and it can generate .bib files for each folder, which I can pipe into quarto and print out somewhere. There’s wrinkles though.\nLet me count the ways. Let’s say I have 10-25 recommended articles per chapter. I could put them all in a single .bib file, and then use [nocite](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/footnotes-and-citations.html#including-uncited-items) to print them all to a reference list at the end of a chapter. This will be a long undifferentiated reference list in alphabetical order. I could probably sort it differently with CSL.\nI remembered that I already started an “additional reading” section in the Eugenics and Psychology chapter. I don’t like how it is presently formatted on the page, but I do like that it appears as a section in the chapter. Hmmm.\nRevisiting that chapter I see that I tried two things. First, I wrote a code chunk to automatically generate a reading list from selected .bib entries in a .bib file. But, I guess I didn’t like how that worked out, because I ended up typing out the references directly.\nHere’s a version of the code chunk:\nThis is OK. What are some other options."

    "text": "Last knit: 2022-11-10\nFor a good few years I have been adopting reproducible workflows for my cognitive psychology research projects. Vuorre and Crump (2021) discussed an R-based approach to creating and sharing research assets in a reproducible manner, and we called it vertical. Since then I have used that approach for most new projects in the lab. However, quarto is the NKOTB, and I’ve been itching to try it for managing assets in a psych research project. And, in the last few days I got the chance to start a project from scratch using quarto, actually several projects. I’m going to digest some of my experiences and lay breadcrumbs for my future self about what I like and am learning so far."

    "text": "The vertical approach\nHere’s an overview of the vertical approach, which uses the R-package template as a starting point for organizing files. This has the benefit of being able to quickly create websites using {pkgdown}. It’s an R-centered approach, which is great for me because I use R for everything. So, if my project includes custom R functions, I can immediately drop them into the R-package template and create an R package for the project. This process can be useful for documenting data from the project too. Additional assets such as experiment script code, posters, manuscripts, etc., are given their own folders. We go into much more depth about vertical in the paper and on the vertical webpage.\n\nUsing vertical for my own projects I gravitated toward following pkgdown guidelines for almost everything. For example, many of the assets I was creating were R Markdown documents. I put those in the vignettes folder, which allows pkgdown to render them automatically. Pkgdown is intended to create websites for R packages and not websites in general, so customizing the website to the needs of particular project can be challenging.\nWhat’s most important to me is adopting an organized and convenient method for creating and sharing assets in a reproducible way. This can be done in many languages, and doesn’t need to be R centric. The same goals can also be accomplished without twisting things like pkgdown into positions they weren’t intended for. Enter quarto."

    "text": "Trying quarto on for size\nQuarto is new, still working out some kinks, but in my experience so far, it’s a mean reproducible document creation machine. And, I heart quarto.\nOver the summer I dabbled with the new quarto book format, and converted my undergraduate statistics textbook from a bs4_book to quarto book. That process was relatively painless, and I was encouraged to try more quarto.\nI often mentor students in the process of learning R for various purposes, and I like to show students how they can make websites and blogs with R Studio, and then use them as a venue to learn R and showcase their work. Blogs and websites were pretty easy before, and they are still very easy with quarto. I had finagled a blog system based on pkgdown rendering vignettes, and after seeing the quarto version I knew I’d make the switch at some point.\nNext semester I’m teaching two courses that will both involve students creating blogs and websites. I was leaning toward using quarto, and now even more so. I have been using a pkgdown approach for building course websites (e.g., like this one for introductory cognition), but after seeing some examples of quarto websites for a course (e.g., like data-science in a box), I decided I needed to try that too (e.g., this emerging course website).\n\nThis week, just before I decided to redo my lab website in quarto, I also tried using quarto for a research project instead of vertical, and that’s what really sold me."

    "text": "Quarto for new research\nI am not sharing this website yet because the project is still in very early stages of development. However, it has been really fun and productive to use quarto from the very beginning of the project.\n\nAt this stage, graduate student Drew Shives and I know our research direction, but we are still doing a lot of reading, combined with stimulus creation, and experiment-idea generation. It’s a lot of creative work that can get messy very fast in terms of keeping track of notes, code, and ideas. This is where I have found using quarto as a personal research organization tool very useful.\nHere’s a quick look at the setup, and why I like it. First, I used R Studio to create a new quarto website project. Then, I modified _quarto.yml as follows:\nproject:\n  type: website\n  output-dir: ../docs/quarto\n\nwebsite:\n  title: \"DRMsource\"\n  navbar:\n    left:\n      - href: index.qmd\n        text: Home\n      - about.qmd\n      - href: ../index.html\n        text: R package\n  sidebar:\n    - title: \"Home\"\n      style: \"floating\"\n      collapse-level: 3\n      align: left\n      contents: auto\n\nformat:\n  html:\n    theme: minty\n    css: styles.css\n    toc: true\n\neditor: visual\nIn quarto 1.2 (pre-release build), there is a really nice feature for auto-generating navigation in the side bar. For example, in the above yaml, under sidebar (which controls the left-side navigation on the webpage), I set the contents option to auto. As a result, the name of any folder in the project will be converted to a section header, and the title of each .qmd inside a folder will be added to navigation list under each section. Here is the current directory structure of the project:\n\nRight now I’m creating things in three different folders: Aims, Design, and Reading. Any .qmd file inside a folder automatically get’s rendered to the website, and listed under sections. I have a .qmd for developing project motivation in the Aims folder, a bunch of .qmds for stimulus generation in the Design folder, and a couple .qmds to keep track of readings in a readings folder.\n\nThis project organization structure may or may not last very long, depending on what happens as we work through the project. Fortunately, it is a snap to change the structure. Just rename the folders, or switch files between folders, and the website automatically updates itself. That’s great.\nLess to do with quarto, and more to do with Rstudio’s new and improved visual editor, I’m super excited about how easy it is to add content in rmd or qmd files. Like it I want to add a screen shot, I take one and drag/drop it onto the text in the visual editor, and it automatically gets added to an images folder. That’s fire. And, zotero integration for easy citing while writing, is more fire.\nSo, hurrah for quarto! And, it’s about to be another Friday night, which means I need to stop writing and hit the render button."

I forked the Hemisphere repo, and am now trying to code my own applets using the hemisphere approach. Using this page to make some notes as I go along.\nI got started messing with O_C yesterday, and made some decent progress (although I don’t really know C++, so it’s slow going).\nI made a copy of the hemisphere source code and am modifying it in my own github repo https://github.com/CrumpLab/O_C-MINERVA. My basic plan is twofold. My overall goal is to start programming essentially weird versions of shift-register/turing machine style sequencers. Ultimately, I have plans to implement some computational models of human memory as eurorack sequencers, in particular Minerva II (Hintzman, 1984, 86, 88). But, to get there I need to learn how to do some more basic stuff.\nMy plan for learning is to systematically re-write my own version of the hemisphere suite to figure out what’s going on, and then hopefully learn enough to start messing with it in musically interesting ways. The rewrite will be way less interesting than what is there already, and will focus on me learning basic operations."

The instructions are clearly laid out on the original O_C site under method B for compiling firmware https://ornament-and-cri.me/firmware/#method_b. There are two methods, and they both word for installing the original or alternative firmwares. Method A involves loading a pre-compiled hex file. Method B compiles from source and then loads. I’m using method B, and in terms of development it works pretty seamlessly (e.g., you can keep the O_C hooked up by usb, and do one-click compile and upload whenever you want).\nYou need three things (links to software on method b link above)\n\ndownload the arduino IDE 1.8.1\ndownload Teensyduino v1.35\nhave a micro-usb cable to connect your computer to the O_C\n\nFirst install the Arduino IDE, then teensyduino, which will ask to install into your arduino app. NOTE: This is where I stupidly ran in a bunch of problems. I confused arduino IDE 1.8.10 for 1.8.1, and spent an hour or two trying to figure out why Teensyduino 1.35 (which is made for Arduino 1.8.1, NOT 1.8.10) wasn’t installing. Yeesh. Anyway, I got it to install just fine once I had the correct versions (I’m on a Mac 10.14.6)."

I haven’t found any clear documentation anywhere, but I could have easily missed it. The code base is really well thought out, so it almost reads like an instruction manual.\nChysn blogged about developing hemisphere suite, and there are numerous helpful tidbits there. He also has another repository with some tutorials on programming O_C firmware https://github.com/Chysn/O_C_Tutorial1. There is a support forum for hemishpere here https://llllllll.co/t/hemisphere-suite-support/21704.\nWhen you load the hemisphere suite firmware, you will get a bunch of “apps”, including the hemisphere suite. For example, some of the apps are the game Pong, the darkest timeline (cool sequencer), ENIGMA (Turing machine variant), others, and hemisphere.\nSo, depending on what you want to do, you could write another “app” that gets added to this list and/or you could write additional modules/applets for the hemisphere suite (there are memory issues, so have to delete something first). Right now I’m only focusing on modules for the hemisphere suite.\nHemisphere splits the O_C into two sides, and each side can load pretty much any of the applets. So, you could have the BootsNCats module loaded on one side to make kicks and snares, and a two channel euclidean sequencer on the other side controlling the kick and snare. Hemisphere has something like 51 different modules that can be loaded. Each side of hemisphere has one button, one endless encoder (with push), two gate inputs, two cv inputs, and two cv outputs, and half of a small screen for graphics."

The input voltages are digitized, transformed if necessary, and then converted back to analog and sent out. The issue is knowing what range of values you are dealing once they are digitized so you know what kind of math to apply to the signals. Fortunately, a lot of these details are sorted out in the hemisphere and original o_c code base, it just takes some time to figure everything out. This post was helpful for me to think about the conversion issues http://butmostlycrime.blogspot.com/2018/09/pitch-calculation-and-output.html. But, I still think I need to understand these issues more clearly.\nAlso, it’s worth reading the specs on the unit https://ornament-and-cri.me/hardware-basics/.\nSome additional poking around helped me understand some of the structure of hemisphere suite. For example, in hemisphere there is a function In() that will read in cv values from the 0 or 1 (e.g., In(0)) channel. This function is defined in the Offset I/O methods section of HemisphereApplet.h. This file further defines other general hemisphere functions for ins and outs, some which are borrowed from the original firmware codebase. For example, the OC::DAC::set_pitch() function is defined in OC_DAC.h. Also, an inspection of software/o_c_Rev will show there are lots of OC files and various others that are recruited as libraries. So, lot’s of great stuff to work with. But, I haven’t seen any documentation about this, beyond the source code itself."

The hemisphere is already well suited to learning from examples, and all I am doing at the moment is copying and modifying existing applets to try and work out what does what.\nTo be a little bit more programmatic about my learning, and perhaps even be useful to other people wanted to try this out I’ve started a copy of hemisphere called O_C-MINERVA https://github.com/CrumpLab/O_C-MINERVA. My goal is to make a set of really basic applets that serve as working examples of really basic stuff. These applets won’t necessarilly be useful for eurorack purposes, but they should be useful as examples for me to return to when I want to start to doing more complicated things. I often tell my students when they are learning to program that they should go through the motions of programming functions for common statistics like the mean, or standard deviation. It’s a good way to learn about details. So, I will take my own advice and try to program basic applets and see what happens."

The goal here was to make a copy of the boilerplate software/HEM_Boilerplate.ino.txt, rename everything to PrintCV, and then figure out how to do two things.\n\nPass CV from the CV in of a channel to CV out of a channel\nTake the digitized CV input value and print it to the screen\n\nThis little applet is at https://github.com/CrumpLab/O_C-MINERVA/blob/master/software/o_c_REV/HEM_PrintCV.ino\nI’ll point out a few pieces. First, passing CV from in to out happens in the Controller function.\n    /* Run during the interrupt service routine, 16667 times per second */\n    void Controller() {\n      ForEachChannel(ch) {  /* Sends CV Ins to Outs */\n        Out(ch, In(ch));\n      }\n    }\nNote, that ForEachChannel() is defined in HemisphereApplet.h as\n#define ForEachChannel(ch) for(int ch = 0; ch < 2; ch++)\nwhich gives a convenient way to loop over channel one and two. Out() and In() are also defined in HemisphereApplet.h. In this case the ch variable just cycles between 0 and 1, covering both the first and second channel. The Controller() function runs at 16667 time per second, and this is the heart where we apply transformations to the digitized signal from the inputs, and send them back to outputs. I’ll note that the above code is sufficient to allow CV inputs 0 and 1 to pass their signal (unmodified) to the outputs 0 and 1.\nThe other thing I wanted to do was print the value of the incoming CV to the screen. This would help me get a sense of the internal values that I’m working with, and also, a PrintCV function could be a useful way to measure actual CV values, especially offset values that are often static (e.g., precision adder). This part is taken care of in two places:\n    /* Draw the screen */\n    void View() {\n        gfxHeader(applet_name());\n        DrawInterface();\n        // Add other view code as private methods\n    }\nThe DrawInterface() function is defined later in the private methods, there are several existing gfx...() functions for drawing to the screen, some of them located in the Offset graphics methods of HemisphereApplet.h.\nprivate:\n\n  void DrawInterface() {\n    gfxPrint(1, 15, \"1: \");\n    gfxPrintVoltage(In(0));\n    gfxPrint(1, 25, \"2: \");\n    gfxPrintVoltage(In(1));\n  }\nI use gfxPrint() to print character values on different lines (controlled by the second y-value, 15, 25, goes down the screen). The gfxPrintVoltage() function will convert the digitized internal value of a current cv channel input to a cv value ranging between -3 and 5 volts (need to double-check this, it’s supposed to be the range of what the O_C hardware is capable of outputting).\n\n\nCVOffset\nThe point of CVOffset was to figure out how to use the rotary encoder to control a cv out voltage. As of right now this applet works, but doesn’t prevent itself from doing things that might cause problems.\n\nAssign some starting value of 0 that will be sent out when the applet loads\n\n\n    /* Run when the Applet is selected */\n    void Start() {\n      digital_cv = 0;\n    }\n\nHere we constantly send out the value in send_cv, which is defined in private\n\n\n    /* Run during the interrupt service routine, 16667 times per second */\n    void Controller() {\n      Out(0,send_cv);\n    }\n\nOnEncoderMove() returns 1 or -1 depending on direction, so I increment or decrement digital_cv on each turn. Then I use the Proportion() function from HemisphereApplet.h (which also defines HEMISPHERE_MAX_CV), to scale a value in terms of 0 to 100, to a voltage. O_C only outputs -3 to 5 so this function doesn’t attempt to control going over or under.\n\n\n    /* Called when the encoder for this hemisphere is rotated\n     * direction 1 is clockwise\n     * direction -1 is counterclockwise\n     */\n    void OnEncoderMove(int direction) {\n      /* output range is -3V and 6V -4608 ~ 9216*/\n      if(direction == 1) {\n        digital_cv++;\n      } else {\n        digital_cv--;\n      }\n      send_cv = Proportion(digital_cv, 100, HEMISPHERE_MAX_CV);\n    }\n\nI draw some stuff on the screen to see some values and get a sense of the transformations.\n\n\nprivate:\n\n  int digital_cv;\n  int send_cv;\n\n  void DrawInterface() {\n    gfxPrint(1, 15, \"1: \");\n    gfxPrint(1, 25, digital_cv);\n    gfxPrint(1, 35, send_cv);\n    gfxPrint(1, 45, HEMISPHERE_MAX_CV);\n  }\n};\n\n\nLofiAudio\nThe specs suggest that OC can output around 16bit, but it is effectively sampling input at around 1khz. This means that if I send an audio source to a cv in, and listen to the output (e.g., I could use PrintCV which has passes in to out) then I should hear low-fi audio…And, yup that works, super fun. I’m going to use this to make a super simple lofi audio applet, now HEM_LofiAudio.ino. I think I’ll leave this, and mention that hemisphere does some audio input processing examples with the drcrusher and lofitape applets.\n\n\nAttenuate\nHemisphere has AttenuateOffset already. But, I should learn how to make just a plain and simple attenuator. E.g., Take CV in, attenuate it by an encoder value, and send the attenuated value out. I can copy PrintCV and make Attenuate from there using some of the AttenuateOffset code. OK, this works as an attenuator.\n    /* Run when the Applet is selected */\n    void Start() {\n      ForEachChannel(ch) level[ch] = 63;\n    }\n\n    /* Run during the interrupt service routine, 16667 times per second */\n    void Controller() {\n      ForEachChannel(ch)\n      {\n          int signal = Proportion(level[ch], 63, In(ch));\n          signal = constrain(signal, -HEMISPHERE_3V_CV, HEMISPHERE_MAX_CV);\n          Out(ch, signal);\n      }\n    }\n\n    /* Draw the screen */\n    void View() {\n        gfxHeader(applet_name());\n        DrawInterface();\n        // Add other view code as private methods\n    }\n\n    /* Called when the encoder button for this hemisphere is pressed */\n    void OnButtonPress() {\n    }\n\n    /* Called when the encoder for this hemisphere is rotated\n     * direction 1 is clockwise\n     * direction -1 is counterclockwise\n     */\n    void OnEncoderMove(int direction) {\n      ForEachChannel(ch) {\n        level[ch] = constrain(level[ch] + direction, 0, 63);\n      }\n    }\nThe level[2] variable is defined later in private. We find the incredibly useful Proportion() and constrain() functions helping us keep cv values in the ranges we need them in. This basic attenuator shows the math, but doesn’t do anything fancy in terms of channel control. There are two channels here, but the encoder value applies the same amount of attenuation to both channels. To implement separate control of each I would look at the hemisphere AttenuateOffset example.\n\n\nSimpleVCA\nHemisphere already has a VCA algorithm called GatedVCA. I haven’t looked at that yet, and am about to. I thought I should learn how to program a VCA. The point will be to have the level of CV 1 control attenuate a CV 2 input for some output, say output 2. Actually before I do this I should make an attenuator…OK did that above. Onto VCA. Let’s modify by copying Attenuate, and working in some code from GatedVCA.\nThis is pretty much all you need for a simple VCA. CV 1 is a signal input. CV 2 is another CV whose value will control attenuation of CV1, the attenuated output is out 2 (send channel is 1, first is 0). Works like a charm.\n    /* Run during the interrupt service routine, 16667 times per second */\n    void Controller() {\n          int signal = In(0);\n          int amplitude = In(1);\n          int output = ProportionCV(amplitude, signal);\n          output = constrain(output, -HEMISPHERE_MAX_CV, HEMISPHERE_MAX_CV);\n          Out(1, output);\n    }\n\n\nSimpleVCO\nThe outputs are 16 bit I think, and can support some VCO action. The original OC had the bytebeat algorithm which sounded really cool. I should try and make some kind of simple VCO with V/Oct pitch control…OK, tried messing with this, and haven’t completed the task. The VectorLFO applet can go into the audio range. BootsNCats shows another example."

Here, Pillsbury uncritically combined past eugenic twin-studies with the new “Army Alpha and Beta” intelligence testing data.

He was the chief psychological examiner in three army camps.[2] During that time he compiled bar graphs with E.S. Jones that showed the predictive value of group psychological tests.[3] His work persuaded government officials to continue the testing program, which ultimately led military officials to order the recording of data on the national origins of the troops tested.[3] The data collected was used in a way that Hunter did not approve; combining the psychological test scores with the location of where the individual grew up supported the notion of Nordic superiority, which was not his intention.[3]”\nMight be worth reading Hunter’s delayed reaction research in animals and children (Hunter 1917). On the hand, it seems that Yerkes advocated that tests of delayed reaction ability could distinguish humans from infra-humans. And, on the other hand, the results were used in the context of debate about mental representations.\n\n\n\n1932 Walter Richard Miles\n\nhired by Terman at Stanford, trained by Carl Seashore, married a psychologist who studied gifted children.\nA funny story about not getting to meet Pearson on a lab visit https://thepsychologist.bps.org.uk/volume-25/edition-8/looking-back-walter-miles-and-his-grand-tour\nwrote a biography of RM Yerkes.

Journal of Experimental Psychology, 7(1), 67–74. This paper is a good example of value-free science. There is an effort to expand testing in schools beyond IQ tests to include other tests measuring traits that also predict performance…e.g., fill in the gaps that IQ misses in terms of variance explained. However, very little is said about what how these tests would be used in society, even though it is clear from the authors own collegial associations that “better” tests would certainly be put to use for eugenics purposes.\nPoffenberger (1922) This paper is basically full on eugenics without using the word. Poffenberger describes how IQ tests can be used to slot people into professions that they are “suitable” for given their IQ. It is an argument to keep “low IQ workers” in their place as laborers, and given the best jobs to people with high IQ, and to worry about how the economy may collapse if people aren’t slotted in based on their IQ.\nPoffenberger (1930) carries on in the tradition of Galton & Cattell to ask what factors make men of science great.

    "text": "First 50 notes\nI need to pause for a bit. I’ve been quickly trying to sketch out some connections between APA presidents and eugenics. Mostly this involves googling their name and eugenics, and pulling the string.\nMy main aim in making these connections is to draw attention to the larger pattern of institutional eugenics within the discipline of Psychology. I am less interested about whether or not specific individuals were “card-carrying” eugenicists, or really truly held eugenics views in their “soul” or not. I think it is enough to establish the pattern and spread of eugenic ideology to consider how eugenics shaped the discipline. For example, I suspect that rampant eugenics had a part to play in systemically limiting the diversity of faculty in Psychology. I suspect it also guided the questions we ask, and continue to ask.\nSo, as a part of reflecting on what I am doing, I drew up a quick spreadsheet of the APP presidents. For the first 50, I gave them each a eugenics score from 0 to 1, with some intermediate scores representing eugenics adjacent work. These are just some rough personal qualitative estimates, to put a number on things. My rough numberization adds up to 34.75 of 50 APA presidents were into eugenics or eugenics adjacent research. Very few were ever explicitly anti-eugenics.\nConsider a sentence like, “It is overwhelming the case that the first 50 years of American Psychology as measured by APA presidents research interests and leadership demonstrate that the discpline of psychology was primarily constructed as arm of the national eugenics movement in the USA”. I just wrote that sentence, and I’m starting to think that I’m not exaggerating."

Adams, Raymond B. Cattell, Francis H. Crick, C. D. Darlington, Charles W. Eriksen, Eric F. Gardner, Quinn McNemar, Eliot Slater, Robert L. Thorndike, Frederick C. Thorne, and Philip E.

    "text": "History of Psychonomics\nI must confess I am a newbie when it comes to the history of Psychology, and specifically the history of its organizational structure in Canada and in the US. I’ve learned a couple things so far. E. G. Boring (1928 APA president) is often credited with starting the History of Psychology. When I read Boring, I find he doesn’t do a good job of contextualizing the history of Psychology in terms of eugenics. I wonder why (I have my suspicions), he certainly worked with and knew a whole bunch of eugenicist psychologists, and it is incredible to believe that he didn’t know about the ideologies of his colleagues. Maybe he thought the eugenics part was so obvious it went without saying…or maybe not.\nAs I write this I’m aware that I haven’t read all of the History of Psych journals, so I don’t know whether or how they reconstruct the history of Psychology from the lens of eugenics. Need to read more about this for myself.\nThere is a tradition in American Psychology of breaking away from the APA (American Psychological Association). The more I learn about the APA, the more I understand why. Psychonomics broke away from the APA, and before looking at that, I wanted to juxtapose the formation of Psychonomics with the formation of another society, The Association of Black Psychology who has been publishing the Journal of Black Psychology since 1974. The ABPsi broke from the APA and in the last half-century have constructed an entire new field in Psychology that is notable for several reasons, including the pursuit of restorative justice for the actions of white racist and eugenicist psychologists against the Black Community. So, I wonder if Psychonomics broke away from the APA for any related reasons…(edit: not so much)."

I admit, I already read the first paper, which is why I am going to talk more about it here.

So, I ended up doing the thing I always do, but should have done from the beginning, and that is, Google “Psychonomics and eugenics”. I did that and I straightaway I found a paper Cleland, Swartz, and McGavern (1979) published by the Psychonomic Society:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is an indication to me that the society at one point condoned aspects of eugenics, and also that some eugenics directed archaeology of Psychonomics is necessary.

    "section": "The founding of Psychonomic Society",
    "text": "The founding of Psychonomic Society\nOK, back to the first paper on the history of Psychonomics. This one is titled, “The founding of the Psychonomics society” (Dewsbury and Bolles 1995). Before I go through it, it’s worth reminding myself (I used to be a history major) what I learned about “history” in undergrad.\nThere is opinion and perspective in historical retelling. So I need to wonder, what lens is used here to discuss the beginnings of Psychonomics?\nHistorical retellings often use the same kinds of tricks. For example, Wilson (n.d.) refers to Ebbinghaus’ quip that “psychology has a long past, but only a short history”. Wilson uses this quip to point out a common narrative structure in historical retelling. In histories of psychology as a science we see the “long” pointers back to the early Greek philosophers. It is often the case that “long” pointing is a way of using juxtaposition to connect some current issue with the significance or value of “well-accepted” historical figures. E.g., psychology continues in the supremely wonderful and great tradition of the righteous and true great traditions of the past…That kind of thing.\nI’ll have an eye out for the “long” pointers as I “read between the lines” of the “The founding of Psychonomics”. Let’s go.\nHere’s the first bit of the paper:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTLDR, the Psychonomics origin story begins with a bunch of white dudes at a bar. I can totally relate to that, because that is pretty much what my experience is like when I go to Psychonomics.\nWe learn that this meet-up was at an AAAS meeting (American Association for the Advancement of Science). Now, far be it from me to criticize the AAAS. And, I have not looked too closely at this organization yet. Suffice it to say, let me connect the AAAS with an important person in its history, James McKeen Cattell. Cattell is a notable eugenicist, as well he was an APA president, and he founded Psychological Review, and he bought Science and edited it for 50 years. I haven’t read this paper yet, but it apparently covers some of the eugenics aspects of AAAS (Farber 2008).\nOK, so some AAAS affiliated Psychologists go to a bar…and two years later Psychonomics was born. Some of those psychologists were “Clarence Graham of Columbia University, Clifford T. Morgan of Johns Hopkins, S. S. Stevens of Harvard, and William S. Verplanck of Hunter College.” I start looking at the scholarship of the organizers further down.\nSo, after the origin story, the founding of Pscyhonomics is set in context of the tradition of splintering off from APA, which many other groups do for various reasons.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe are pulled back to into the living room of G. Stanley Hall in 1892, at the dawn of the APA. I would say that Hall was deeply into eugenics, for some connections see.\nI think it is also fair to say that the first presidential address published in the first issue of Psych Review in 1894 by George Trumball Ladd (2nd APA president, also frequent contributor to the Journal of Race Development…) was about establishing the place of psychology in Science. From the very beginning the eugenicists involved in Psychology were very eager to establish and maintain the scientific purity of Psychology. This a theme that sometimes is used to give psychologists cover to conduct “science” in a “value-free”, “objectively neutral” way (see Yakushko (2019a) on scientism). FYI, I also think that Ladd was dog-whistling to the eugenicists in the crowd in his final thoughts about using psychology for the betterment of society. It is also highly interesting to inspect the first issue of Psych Review for known eugenicists (e.g., Francis Galton, founder of eugenics, publishes on his ability to arithmetic by smell).\nNext, we learn about some previous splits within the APA.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWould you be surprised if Leta Hollingworth was a racist and eugenicist? See here wikipedia page. She was also married to another eugenicist psychologist Harry Levi Hollingworth, who was president of the APA in 1927. You could read Wallin’s eugenics here (Wallin 1914). This split didn’t last long and the APA recouped the AACP, and established the first “section” in the APA. Neato, I didn’t know that.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is an acknowledgement of the role that WW II played in the discipline of psychology. There are many connections between psychologists and war efforts in the US, and without going into that history, let me point out a primary theme is eugenics, and many of the psychologists involved were also members of eugenics societies. We see some mention of some other societies, like SEP (Society of Experimental Psychologists)…notably this exclusive honor club of psychologists still gives the Howard Crosby Warren medal every year. HC Warren was another APA president (1913), and he is listed in the Eugenical News as an active researcher. But, the main point of this paragraph is the italicized two words “and practice”, whereby the new bylaws of the APA included “practice” alongside science, as a way into the APA. It seems like the scientists didn’t like this very much. They didn’t want the science to be watered down. I get that.\nWe are then treated to a context of previous attempts to make scientific clubs of psychologists, where psychologists could just finally hang out and be scientists with each other.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe experimentalists were notable misogynists, and they grew into the SEP, which maintained its misogynistic roots. I won’t go into the membership of SEP, because this about Psychonomics, and SEP is another day.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPart of the point in this history could be to establish the “long” roots of Psychonomics by tying it to preceding exclusive honor societies. There is much cross-fertilization between the societies, as noted throughout this paper (and even today).\nNext, we learn about earlier efforts by Titchener’s group to create scientific space within APA conferences of the 20s.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI haven’t found Titchener connect himself with eugenics in his writing, but Boring is certainly eugenics adjacent (having with worked with Yerkes in the army IQ testing effort). Dallenbach and Fernberger I don’t know much about. Dallenbach was on an NRC committee with several other known eugenics proponents. Fernberger wrote a biography for HC Warren, wrote on “the problem of mental disorders”, and seems eugenics adjacent at first glance. J. E. Anderson was APA president in 1943, and wrote “The Modern baby Book and Child Development Record”, which follows in the footsteps of Galton’s eugenics approach. Raymond Dodge was APA president in 1916, did some IQ testing during the war, and supported some eugenics policies, but doesn’t appear to be a major public advocate of eugenics. Haven’t looked into Robinson, but he writes about the great need to apply science to “the problem of public intelligence”. Shepard like many his contemporaries worked in testing of the military during the war.\nIt seems that this effort of organization didn’t really work, and the group fizzled.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut, it’s interesting that very notable people (“stalwarts”) were in attendance: Harvey Carr, Clark Hull, Joseph Jastrow, H. C. Warren, and Robert S. Woodworth. T. All of these men were deeply into eugenics, and they were also all one-time presidents of the APA see some notes on each here.\nHuh, next we learn about another fascinating society in Psychology, the psychological round table, or PRT…If you followed my twitter account last summer, you would know that I tweeted a bunch about them. They are a “well-kept-secret” honor society that still exists today. They have a smelly history of misogyny. They keep their member list close to their chests. Who knows what their members think about eugenics? It’s just one of those questions that has to be asked in a blog post using the lens of eugenics to explore this paper.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI think the TLDR here is that Psychonomics should be proud that among its founders were esteemed members of PRT. Congrats, give yourself a pat on the back.\nPRT had GUV as a sister “secret society”, so ya. Hi GUV friends, wave.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAgain we have a list of names of well known psychologists. I’ll point to one small puzzle. I know C. W. Eriksen because he invented the flanker task. I’ve been asking myself, what does that have to do with eugenics? After all, I have used that task on numerous occasions. Well, the puzzle is not about the flanker task. Nope, it is why does C. W. Eriksen appear in a footnote in Kuhl’s (Kühl 2013) book on eugenics? It’s because Eriksen was among several other psychologists (with eugenics connections) who signed a letter supporting Arthur Jensen, who has often been characterized as a racist psychologist.\nfrom Kuhl: “The ten other scholars were Jack A. Adams, Raymond B. Cattell, Francis H. Crick, C. D. Darlington, Charles W. Eriksen, Eric F. Gardner, Quinn McNemar, Eliot Slater, Robert L. Thorndike, Frederick C. Thorne, and Philip E. Vernon; cf. JBA Oxford, G. 14. The activity was at first coordinated by the psychologist Ellis B. Page of the University of Connecticut; cf. Jensen to Dobzhansky, 9/2/1972, THA Philadelphia: Jensen, Arthur R.”\nAnyway, let’s continue with the paper.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInteresting, I did not know that there was a failed attempt to remove division 3 (exp in psych) from APA in 1948. But, I certainly have learned about big names in Experimental Psychology who were eugenicists, like Thorndike, Watson and Lashley. I haven’t looked at Spence or Graham. For Spence I will just point out that we worked under Yerkes and Hull, so it seems very likely he was exposed to his mentors’ eugenics. It would be interesting to look at Spence’s scholarship from the lens of the eugenics ideology of his mentors. (edit: I do that a bit later).\nAlright, we have arrived at the beginning of the Psychonomics Society:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s take a look at the table events:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore names:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd a table of membership of the organizing committee (from the American Men of Science):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInteresting to note the ages, so many members were all kicked out of PRT and GUV.\nMore people get involved. I love how “diverse” and “white males” was working into the paragraph.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere was some discussion and dissent about the purposes and directions of the new society. I wonder how much of that discussion had to do with restorative justice for survivors of eugenics at that time. I wasn’t there, maybe it wasn’t on the radar.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSome of the tension in the story appears to be the need to fight for science in psychology, and to make a society that shows everyone why science and psychology is so important. A story like this has been drilled into me over the years. IMO, science shouldn’t be an excuse to do psychology.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd now, we go back to the bar:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShould I go to Appendix D now, or later…it’s choose your own adventure. Let’s do it, Appendix D says :\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor my two cents, the part at the bottom resonates very strongly. It seems there was an elitist contingent from the PRT. Ever wonder why graduate students don’t give talks at Psychonomics? Maybe this is why. The elitists won.\nBack to the paper. So, 950 invitations were sent out to potential members, the name Psychonomics was adopted and incorporated in 1960. There is an appendix on the name “Psychonomics”. I’ll get to that later.\n“The First Annual Scientific Meeting of the Psychonomic Society The first meeting of the Psychonomic Society was held at the University of Chicago on September 1-3, 1960, just before the 1960 APA meetings. Approximately 294 individuals attended, of whom 195were members, 79 were guests, and approximately 20 were unregistered. The program included 119 papers in 24 sessions arranged in eight time blocks with three concurrent sessions each; four blocks on Thursday, three blocks and an afternoon business meeting on Friday, and one block on Saturday morning. They were grouped into 15 categories. The nature of the experimental psychology ofthe time, at least for the members of the new Psychonomic Society, can be seen in the distribution of papers across sessions; these are presented in Table 3.”\nLet’s look at Table 3:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOh no, it seems that the potpourri session has basically disappeared in terms of modern Psychonomics. Now, should I stay or should I go find the 1960 conference abstracts. I guess I should do that. I’m going to do that now, wish me luck.\nNo dice yet, couldn’t find the conference abstracts after a quick search. Not sure which archive they are in. In any case, it would be interesting read about the genetics session and a few others.\nWell, maybe spoke to soon. I can do things like search “paper presented to the Psychonomic Society, 2 September 1960” in Google scholar, and restrict the dates to 1960. Then a few papers that were read at psychonomics in 1960 come up. A start anyway. Here’s an example, still would be nice to get the full list at some point.\n\nJerison, H. J. (1961). Quantitative analysis of evolution of the brain in mammals. Science, 133(3457), 1012-1014.\n\nAlright, some stuff happened at the first conference. We learn that it wasn’t really too much different than division 3 APA conferences. Then there is the first business meeting, a first newsletter, etc.\nSome thorns in the side, or additional reasons why Psychonomics needed to be created, it seems APA was making actual presentations of research more difficult. Kind of funny to imagine Estes’ apparatus solution to the problem.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt seems that Psychonomics could be the place where science happened, and still be affiliated with the APA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat’s in a name…Also, more in the appendix, which I will get to later. Also, some icky quotes in here…what’s on page 5 !!!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSome membership features:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI guess this part went out the window, said the fellow researching the foundations of the fellow-less society he is a fellow of.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere was a distinct lack of diversity:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo this is why Psychonomics is just about coffee…keeps the cost of the conference down though (and I very much appreciate that…Also, I should say I very much appreciate Psychonomics, and the only reason I am spending this much time looking into the history of Psychonomics is because of how much I appreciate this society.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen some more stuff about restricting papers and talks to members. LET THE GRADUATE STUDENTS GIVE TALKS ALREADY.\nGovernance structure is supposedly lean and in the style of PRT…not sure if that is good or bad. I’ve never been involved with governance at Psychonomics. Can’t say anything about what it’s like now.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPsychonomics journals didn’t work out right away, but eventually started happening, courtesy of Clifford Morgan.\nThe concluding paragraph.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo a simple history of Psychonomics is that it is a lean organization for scientific psychologists to talk about their science. And it is does that very well.\nSocieties have many members and viewpoints and it’s unclear what kinds of views Psychonomics members have had over time about issues such as eugenics, or about tolerating or not tolerating other members’ views on such issues.\n\nTime for a small break.\nAside from eugenics, I wonder how many folks from the governing board of Psychonomics and say all of the journals are also members of PRT and GUV? I would guess quite a few. If so, there is a “hidden” layer of elitism to the society, and if you are not part of the club…like moi, then I guess sucks to be you (or me as it happens)."

    "text": "Naming Psychonomics\nOn the naming of Psychonomics from the appendix:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI’ll point out that James Mark Baldwin also wrote, “The mental development in the child and race: methods and processes (Baldwin, 1900)”. And, that curiously the word “flow” is often used in eugenics literature (see chpt 6 of Yakushko (2019a)). These are obviously juxtaposition to eugenics, and I don’t know the eugenics literature well enough yet to know if there are additional connections. Anyway, I thought these connections were worth noting.\nThe rest of the appendix reads:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI’ve had a little bit more time to look at “Psychonomic” in the context of eugenics and social darwinism, and I found that it also has a meaning in terms of the “general psychonomic law”. I found this in a footnote from Goodchild (2012) who discusses G. Stanley Hall (one-time APA president and eugenicist)\n“Cremin, Transformation of the School, 101–2. Cremin described Hall’s foundational idea exceptionally well.”Hall’s basic thesis—the ‘general psychonomic law,’ which he borrowed from Haeckel and Spencer—was that ontogeny, the development of the indi- vidual organism, recapitulates phylogeny, the evolution of the race.”\nI dunno, seems like the general psychonomic law also has a meaning in terms of eugenics writing. Or maybe I’m just reading way too much into this. Here’s Hall in his own words…\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYup, psychonomics is a word that also has meaning in eugenics writing. So, there’s that.\nA final thought on this is the historical tradition of harkening back to something of perceived value. Is it possible that in establishing a new society, the founders chose the word “Psychonomics” to harken back to the beginning of the APA, and reference the eugenics writings of the first APA president, G. Stanley Hall? It’s a question that falls out of the eugenic analysis lens.\n\nThere are three more papers on the history of Psychonomics on their website, and I’ll read those a little bit later. Some of the next steps that I should take include looking more closely at the scholarship of the organizers. Considering the large amount of eugenics oriented research in the APA up to this time, and considering that Psychonomics was mainly planning to be a society that continued APA division 3 research, it would be surprising if the early days of Psychonomics did not include eugenics oriented research.\nAt the same time, we are now talking about 1960 and onward, a time in history when it became more unpopular to use the word eugenics (often attributed to widespread public rejection of eugenics following revelations of Nazi war crimes), and to talk openly about promoting eugenics. So, unlike pre 1945 where it was rather easy to line up psychologists who published in psychology and eugenics journals, or otherwise self-identified as being a eugenicist, it seems like more of a challenge to determine whether psychologists in the 60s were involved in eugenics.\nBefore I start to look more closely at the scholarship of organizing members, I’d like to mention a few points of interest. For myself, I have been wondering about the connections between eugenics and the cognitive revolution. Psychonomics appears right in the same time frame as the cognitive revolution. I have spent many years thinking about cognition, and basically never thought of myself as contributing in anyway to programs of eugenics. I’ve been asking basic questions about basic psychological processes. How is that related to eugenics?\nIn any case, here are a few tidbits that have started to inform my thinking about the cognitive revolution. First, it is obvious that the history of individual differences psychology is tightly interwoven with eugenics. The development of IQ testing and psychometrics were employed as tools of eugenics many times over in many different venues in society. It was less obvious to me how experimental psychology was involved. One way was that many formative psychologists in experimental psychology were eugenicists, Thorndike, Watson, Lashley, Hull…the list goes on.\nAt one point I jumped ahead of myself (in terms of going through the APA presidents), and I looked George A. Miller & eugenics. Most of us know Miller for his magic number 7 + or - 2 paper. That paper was also about applying ideas from Claude Shannon’s information theory to information processing limitations in psychology. Well, guess where Claude Shannon did his master’s thesis. At the eugenics record office in Cold Springs Harbor (Long Island New York). This is one of those weird eugenics connections.\nIt took some googling but eventually I found George Miller explain his version of eugenics in 1967 in Miller (1967). Miller inverts a common fear of morons that eugenicists usually foment about. Eugenicists like H. Goddard (Goddard 1927) exclaim that morons are everywhere, they look like everyone else, but they are morons because of their IQ, and they must be removed from society or else society will collapse. Miller, in his futurism about the year 2000, says the society will become too complex rendering everyone morons, so basically we need to do something about it or else. Miller cryptically talks about when “the day comes that we have the necessary facts to support a realistic eugenics program, such information could be valuable.” Miller doesn’t say who he wishes to eliminate, he’s cryptic. Still, he thanks his buddy R.J. Hernnstein at the beginning, probably for all the chats about eugenics (Hernnstein would later publish “the Bell curve”).\nStill, what did this have to do with cognition? Well, Miller also explains how it obvious that information processing capacity needs to be increased in order for society to survive. It’s plain old Intelligence-exalting, fear-mongering, Galtonian eugenics with fancy words. So, there is some ideology between Miller’s magic number. And it apparently has to do with eugenics.\nSecond, although I still have to confirm this, it appears that Abraham Maslow was deeply into eugenics, but only wrote about it privately, and this was only made generally available to public upon publishing of some of his private notes.\nI mention these two examples primarily because it may be difficult to suss out eugenic ideology among psychologists who don’t share their views publicly, but continue nevertheless to conduct science that has eugenic implications. So, it’s a bit of a warning to myself to not get carried away with wondering if someone is really a eugenicist or not. It’s not for me to decide. One of primary aims is to document more clearly the structural eugenics aspects. In other words, I think at some point it will become clear enough that there was a bunch of eugenics going on, and that this shaped our discipline, and if this is true, it is something Psychonomics has to deal with."

They were also very good at sitting as chairmen in US government committees (see the NRC 1919-1933 division of anthropology & Psychology). It would be kind of astounding to me if there was no interest among eugenicists in having a piece of Psychonomics from the very beginning. Let’s take a look.\nAlso, what follows are personal notes, sometimes interspersed with “maybe” eugenic-adjacent things, sometimes things I’m interested in returning to for other reasons.

He also coined the concept “inadequate learning syndrome” (ILS) and argued it was a more important social problem than the AIDS epidemic (Humphreys, 1988).\nAmid the controversy generated by publication of The Bell Curve in 1994, Humphreys wrote a target article (Humphreys, 1994), which stimulated a series of comments by a number of prominent scholars in the field. He generated further controversy by accepting funding from the Pioneer Fund. He was also one of 52 signatories on “Mainstream Science on Intelligence,[3]” an editorial written by Linda Gottfredson and published in the Wall Street Journal, which defended the findings on intelligence in The Bell Curve.\nHumphreys, L.

    "text": "Psychonomic Journals\nThe second paper on the history of Psychonomics discusses the journals and issues around publishing them. Some interesting stories about the publishing side of things. (Dewsbury 1996)\n\nPsychonomic Science\nRunning out of steam a bit. I’ve perused a bit through the journal Psychonomic Science, which runs from 1964 to 1972. There are a smattering of papers that are eugenics adjacent IMO, but it mostly seems like fairly standard Psychonomics fare. It’s really great most of these papers are open access, I love this about Psychonomics. The journal also publishes some of the abstracts from Psychonomics conferences. I took a quick look at a few of them, and didn’t see any more papers with eugenics in the title like this Cleland, Swartz, and McGavern (1979), which seems like a rarity. Also, the word “eugenic” and “eugenics” return no results from the journal.\n\n\nPsychonomic Monograph Supplements\nFor whatever reason I didn’t have an easy time searching the table of context of Psychonomic monograph supplements. It seems that Springer does not index this one?\n\n\nBulletin of the Psychonomic Society\n1973-1993\nInteresting new concept that members are their own editors, so they can publish things and take responsibility for them. I think this means no peer review (see Morgan’s editorial in first issue). This is the journal that published the one positive eugenics paper mentioned earlier. One other paper used the word eugenics when they references an article from a eugenics journal.\nThere are several papers returned by genetics, lots of intelligence papers, and some race-based papers. There’s 20 years of publications, and that’s a whole of reading, maybe some other time.\nOops, spoke to soon. Gray (1983) is a very real eugenics treat in 1983, straight out of Galton’s playbook. Wow. Maybe peer-review is a good idea after all?\n\n\nPerception and Psychophysics (now APP)\nA search of “eugenic” returns no results, and “eugenics” returns 5 papers involving references to papers eugenics journals.\n\n\nPsychobiology\nNeat, I didn’t even know this journal existed. It’s on the list of retired journals.\nNo articles are returned when searching ‘eugenic’ or ‘eugenics’. Certainly no shortage of interesting papers.\nI searched “Galton” and found these two papers that I had never come across before.\nBurton, P. G. (1990). A search for explanation of the brain and learning: Elements of the psychonomic interface between psychology and neurophysiology I. A cognitive approach to early learning. Psychobiology, 18(2), 119-161.\nBurton, P. G. (1990). A search for explanation of the brain and learning: Elements of the psychonomic interface between psychology and neurophysiology II. Early behavior and its control, the origin of consciousness, and the rise of symbolic thought. Psychobiology, 18(2), 162-194.\nThese are pretty interesting cybernetics inspired papers. Neat that “psychonomic” is used as a process (see naming Psychonomics section). The author also has patent that seeks to provide an objective measure of individual differences in cognitive processing https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/fe/d7/5a/421ac1821dd66d/US20080039698A1.pdf. If I wasn’t using a eugenics lens here I would normally say, oh neat, a thoughtful theory and a useful new tool. But, I could also see value in having work like this contextualized with respect to the history of eugenics in psychology and society.\n\n\nPsychonomic Bulletin and Review\nTwo papers show up in a search for “eugenics”, that reference papers in eugenics journals. One of them is slightly on the eugenics nose in how it references and uses RA Fishers ideas (not about statistics).\nThere is this paper:\nRushton, J. P., & Ankney, C. D. (1996). Brain size and cognitive ability: Correlations with age, sex, social class, and race. Psychonomic Bulletin & Review, 3(1), 21-36.\n\n\nMemory and Cognition\neugenic and eugenics returns no results, see interim question below\n\n\nLearning and Behavior\n“eugenics” comes up in one citation\n\n\nBehavior Research Methods\n6 papers returned searching “eugenics”, all occurring in citations, mostly RA Fisher stats stuff.\nThis is an interesting paper to pluck out:\nDavenport, J. W., Benson, R. W., Hagquist, W. W., Rankin, G. R., & Shelton, S. E. (1972). Computerized animal intelligence testing. Behavior Research Methods & Instrumentation.\nI bet Tolman would have loved to have this automated contraption when he attempted to breed rats for maze learning ability.\nTolman, E. C. (1924). The Inheritance of Maze-Learning Ability in Rats. Journal of Comparative Psychology, 4(1), 1.\n\n\nCognitive, Affective, & Behavioral Neuroscience\nNo results returned searching “eugenic” or “eugenics”\n\n\nCognitive Research: Principles and Implications\nThis is a new journal, and in general I think use-based cognitive research is pretty great, so there is much to like about this journal. I haven’t submitted anything here, but I do some work on cognitive technologies, such as with the semantic librarian project.\nThe words “eugenic” and “eugenics” don’t appear yet in this journal. It’s a new journal and probably many researchers, like me only a couple weeks ago, aren’t thinking about eugenics everyday or at all. I could imagine the story of eugenics in psychology as it relates to “use-based” practices of “psychological research” being relevant to guiding modern discussion of applied cognitive research.\n\nInterim question: Why doesn’t the word eugenics appear more often in Psychonomics journals?\nI’m not wondering about the absence of papers that explicitly advocate in favor of eugenics (it is still pretty wierd that there are papers like this in the Psychonomic record). I’m wondering about the distinct lack of discussion and contextualization of reseach in terms of eugenics. For example, there doesn’t appear to be a paper that examines historical and contemporary research aims and methods in Psychonomics from the lens of eugenics. Maybe, I’m just motivating myself to fill a gap in the literature.\nFor example, there are numerous papers about “intelligence”. And, even though that area has extensive connections to eugenics, and remains a controversial area, it doesn’t appear that these issues are discussed directly in papers that use the word intelligence. (I’m inferring this by the fact that searching “intelligence AND eugenics” returns zero results)."

    "text": "Random stuff\nI would never recommend reading the journal “Mankind Quarterly”. However, it is interesting to read one author’s perspective on the founding of Psychonomics, in the paper title “Raymond B Cattell and the Fourth Inquisition”, by W Glade. Basically, Cattell is a racist and the APA declines to give him an award even though he showed up to receive it. Anyway, it’s a head spinning dose of WTF. Nevertheless, the claim is that Psychonomics scientists were tired of this kind of “leftist” crap, and left APA because it was getting too “political”.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis article from Rushton (a notable racist) suggest that the Pioneer Fund (notorious funder of racist science) has funded a past Psychonomics president (chair I assume). - https://philipperushton.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/The-Pioneer-Fund-and-the-Scientific-Study-of-Human-Differences-2002-by-John-Philippe-Rushton.pdf\n\nThese pieces are not about psychonomics, but I came across them in current efforts so am placing them here. They are reviews by R Held and GA Miller.\n\nReviewed Work(s): Group Processes: Transactions of the First Conference by Bertram Schaffner Review by: Richard Held, The American Journal of Psychology, Vol. 69, No. 4 (Dec., 1956), pp. 690-692\nReviewed Work(s): Cybernetics: Circular Causal and Feedback Mechanisms in Biological and Social Systems, Transactions of the Eighth Conference by Heinz von Foerster, Margaret Mead and Hans Lukas Teuber, Review by: George A. Miller, The American Journal of Psychology, Vol. 66, No. 4 (Oct., 1953), pp. 661-663\n\n\nWhat is interesting about these reviews is that both authors illustrate how to talk elliptically or cryptically about ideas that loom over the discipline. Both reviews are about conference books/proceedings, and both authors use subtext and allusion to reference ideologies that appear to loom large at the conferences. Could be fun to read the book review sections of AJP! More broadly, this time period is very different from the earlier decades in terms of open discussion of the subtext. For example, in decades prior some eugenicists published their views in eugenics journals and their methods in psychology journals. That kind of parallelism of ideology and method isn’t very common anymore, making dot connection more difficult."

Many towering figures in Psychology are members. I confess to not knowing very much about the society beyond some of the people on the member list. I don’t know how that society reflects upon its associations with eugenics that exist via its own membership. Eugenics was certainly widespread and socially acceptable from 1904 onward for many decades, and many Psychologists were committed to eugenics movements. Some of these psychologists were members of SEP.\nI’ll look at the early members from a paper by E Boring, shared from the SEP website. This is the 1904-1938 time period. The members in order of being elected to the society were:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt’s interesting to cross-reference this list of members with lists of memberships from Eugenics societies, lists from eugenical news, and other potentially revealing sources like who C Davenport corresponded with.

I’ve started with an excel spreadsheet, but I’m not happy with that method. There are other connections besides membership affiliations. I need to do some thinking about a database approach…"

    "text": "Database thoughts\nConsider the problem of assessing possible associations between eugenics and members of a psychology society. So far I’ve been taking a rough collection approach going through the APA presidents, organizers of Psychonomcis, and now looking at SEP. The approach has been to state a name, and then copy some notes about factoids and references that might be relevant in terms of eugenics connections. Once in a while there are some explicit signs, such as being a member of eugenics society.\nI’d like some way of assessing these connections more programmatically, such that I apply some kind of similar standard to everyone in terms assessing eugenics associations. Maybe things are just more complicated than this, and every person has their own unique story (of course, this is true too).\nI need to reflect on what I’m actually trying to accomplish in this research. It started off as an interesting subject matter that I felt compelled to learn more about. An early thought was that I might be better able to understand aspects of institutional racism in Psychology. For example, if it was true that there was widespread eugenics within Psychology for a long time, especially in the organizations and leadership of Psychology organizations, then perhaps this legacy is responsible for aspects of today’s psychology. And, identifying and describing these insititutional features could then hopefully lead to some deconstruction and reconstruction.\nI am still mainly interested in characterizing the institutional aspects of eugenics in psychology, as well as how our modern institutions have reacted to the history. I am not that interested in what specific people “really” thought about issues of the day. For many, I’m sure that eugenics was rationalized as a great morally progressive project for society. Probably also some people changed their minds on committments to various ideologies over time.\nMy view is that eugenics campaigns were waged on people in society in numerous ways. There are many differnent kinds of eugenics survivors. Psychologists were active and complicit in many ways in eugenics campaigns. This side of psychology should be acknowledged more often.\nAnyway, I’ve lost the thread, I’m supposed to be thinking about databases. What kind of database would I want to have?\nLet’s go back to the list of SEP members. What kind of database could be useful to ask questions about eugenics activities and each member?\nNarrative descriptions. One way to go is to do a biography of each person, entertain the lens of eugenics, and then make some judgment calls, and say a few words in summary about the level or nature of their eugenics activities. This is probably the best to way to portray the nuance of the issues for each person. This would take some time.\nSadly, I have no training in qualitative research, and I’m a hack historian.\nHowever, I have been eyeing something for a while, maybe it could be useful here. I have been developing “semantic” search engines for text corpora using cognitive models of semantics (corpus-based distributional models like BEAGLE). Several examples are available here, including the abstracts from the last Psychonomics conference https://www.semanticlibrarian.com.\nI’ve been meaning to take the semantic librarian project into the domain of digital humanities. For example, could a tool for document similarity analysis based on cognitive models be useful in the context of historical research? Maybe a semantic librarian could be helpful here.\nTBH, I’ve been anticipating a day like today for a while. For example, I’ve been trying to make semantic librarian’s easier to use by sharing R code necessary to create your own https://crumplab.github.io/RsemanticLibrarian/. Most of the semantic librarians I’ve built are for abstracts, so they are structured in a particular way that supports searching by author and year etc. However, there is a much more general notion to the semantic librarian, which is a kind of semantic mixed-methods database. The minimal example is here https://crumplab.github.io/RsemanticLibrarian/articles/Alice.html. Actually, the best example a wine “Sommeantic Librarian” that I made with a mixed database (basically wine reviews coded by several factors) https://crumplab.shinyapps.io/somme/.\nSo, partly I guess I’m sayng I should use this stuff here somehow. The semantic librarian approach will take a while. And, sure I could create semantic vector for eugenics and then compare similarity to names and authors in the database. That would be interesting I suspect, but it would be difficulty to know what the similarity scores actually represent. Still, something worth doing I think.\nAside from that, I could try some related methods.\nI’m imagining each person as a JSON object, where each person can have properties.\n\nPerson = Name\n\neugenics = total score?\nProperties\n\neugenics membership: TRUE/FALSE\neugenics in private correpsondence: TRUE/FALSE\n\n\n\nSomething like the above, where it could be expandable as I learn that I need to add different kinds of attributes, and then I could develop some way of assessing the “data” for each person, potentially assigning a eugencis score.\nAt the end of the day it would be nice to figure out these kinds of flavors about individuals\n\npro and active in eugenics\nanti-eugenics\nnot involved or associated in eugenics\naccidental eugenics\neugenics adjacent\nfunctional contributions in the service of eugenics\n\nI guess I’m most interested in assessing a society or organization for its functional contributions to eugenics, as a way of determining the amount and quality of instutional/systemic eugenics for an organization. So, obviously I need to take heed of SS Stevens, and do a better job of operationalizing these things."

That’s fine. In using eugenics as a historical lens, it could be enough that this lens is useful for capturing aspects of Psychonomic research in a new light.\nFor example, I would argue base on G. A. Miller’s own words, that his research into information processing capacity limitations was eugenics adjacent research. Rather than IQ, Miller used bits and chunks to characterize bandwidths of information processing capacity, and he clearly saw this as important in the context of eugenics.\nA larger issue looms for basic cognitive research. If one is studying a basic cognitive process, and one thinks about this process as having qualities of function that are good vs bad, or efficient vs inefficient, or desirable vs undesirable, and one intends to clarify how the process works for the purposes of identifying the quality of that process among individuals in a population, and then does this for the purpose of positive or negative eugenics…well, that would be eugenics wouldn’t it. From my perspective, cognition should take an anti-eugenics stand, and commit to work and perspectives on the work that actively guard against eugenics."

    "text": "1 Standpointing Eugenics\nI’m only on pg. 2, but had to start writing. I’m not a social scientist, so have much to learn about theory and practice in that domain. Concurrently with researching eugenics I am also reading through the Journal of Black Psychology. In this other avenue of reading, I am finding that I am overwhelmingly impoverished as a white male in understanding many Black issues. I have no lived experience as a Black person, how could I understand? I mention this because it connects to standpoint theory. I’d never heard of standpoint epistemology before, and Wilson summarizes it as, “standpoint theory emphasizes the positive value that thinking about knowledge and value from certain kinds of marginalized standpoint can have”. The take home for me is that “lived experience” brings something valuable the table. I dig that very much. So, Wilson says he will present a standpoint eugenics, or at least a standpoint-ish eugenics.\nWilson’s eugenics in a nutshell, “Eugenics arose in the nineteenth century both as a proposed, meliorative science–a science of human improvement or betterment– and as a social movement…distinctive aim to use science/tech to regulate the sorts of people there would be in future generations”. This is fairly neutral language for what was/is an aggressively racist and classist movement that has committed atrocities all around the world.\npg. 9, James Watson appointed to director of the Office of Human Genome Research 1988…Watson was director of Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory since 1968, previously the Eugenics Record Office, and has expressed several pro-eugenics views after leaving the directorship.\npg. 10, early 2000s 4/33 states that passed sterilization laws made apologies, following legal settlements in Alberta between survivors and the province that sterilized them\npg. 11 “…view of eugenics as simply a regrettable past…” this seems like a common and very unfortunate view of eugenics that needs to change. Especially given the “recent revelations of ongoing sterilizations in Australia, California, and India…”\npg. 11– Eugenics survivor Leilani Muir and her legal battle against Alberta…classified as a “moron” as child see Psychologist/Eugenicist Henry Goddard’s and his IQ advocacy.\nTODO: need to flesh out what I will call the “moron hysteria” created by IQ testing and Goddard among others. Goddard argued for classifying “feeble-minded” people into classes by IQ, e.g., idiots ~ 20, Imbeciles ~ 40, Morons ~ 70, see Goddard’s “Who is a Moron?” Goddard (1927). The fear was that morons are basically normal competent people who are able to hide in society, but they will also destroy the human race if they are allowed to breed. The only way to discover morons was to IQ test them, and then employ eugenics polices to prevent morons from breeding.\npg. 13 – Institutional complicity…guess who was the founding chair of the U of Alberta’s Philosophy Department? Prof. John MacEachran, the original head of Alberta’s Eugenics Board. He was the longest serving department chair…continued to approve sterilizations until he was 88 (eugenics board in Alberta repealed in 1972).\nI’m pretty sure that Psychology as a discipline has not grappled with, understood, apologized for, and repaired it’s own institutional complicity in eugenics. I mean 31 of the first many APA president’s were eugenics leaders (Yakushko 2019).\npg. 15-16. Wow, boning up on my recent Albertan history that happened while I lived there. Premier Ralph Klein tried to use the notwithstanding clause to limit any settlements made to eugenics survivors for any reason. This legislation was withdrawn in 24 hours because of public backlash.\npg. 16 - interesting, U of A phil dept. makes a small committee in 1998 “the MacEachran Sub-Committee”, that displayed the history, and made recommendations (e.g., take down MacEachran’s name, don’t use his him for honorifics, ensure teaching of eugenics in courses)"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Last knit: 2022-11-10\nThe Association of Black Psychology has been publishing the Journal of Black Psychology since 1974. I just learned about it. So, I’m reading it because that’s what you do when you find out that you missed an entire foundational field in psychology.\nI’m a cognitive psychologist who spends a large part of my research time considering how cognition in general is supported by computations of learning and memory processes. I’m also interested in psychology more broadly: how it fits together as a discipline, and how the institutions of psychology work, how psychology influences society, etc.\nMy impression of my own field is that it is highly fragmented. There’s lots of everyone doing their own thing. There is no unified field theory of anything. Wondering about the “point” of things in cognitive psychology has sucked years of my life away. I guess I enjoy it, and like many other disciplines, perhaps struggling with the point is part of the point. Points don’t come for free.\nSometimes I’ve used a hole digging metaphor for research. I go dig a new hole somewhere, and convince everyone else that no one looked in the hole before. If you do a good of this, you can dig into that hole for the rest of your life and never have to leave. I have dug some holes that I’d like to get out of.\nRelatedly, I was appalled by Psych Science publishing a now retracted racist IQ paper. I hadn’t been paying attention to the scope of racism in my own discipline. By tugging at the thread of the history of IQ research, which I also mostly didn’t learn about in my training, I discovered how much eugenics played a role in founding and propagating psychology (Yakushko 2019).\nI’m in the process of climbing out of my research hole to learn about the racist and eugenicist ideologies systemic to psychology. As a part of this work, I found out the Journal of Black Psychology has been dismantling these issues from their inception, so I’m here to learn from the experts.\nI’ve already done some reading and skimming through the journal. So, even though I know this work will inform me about structural racism and eugenics in psychology, I also know it will inform me about many other issues that I wasn’t thinking so much about. The papers I have read so far are building towers of perspective over the holes of psychology. I’m excited to read more, I need to start keeping notes:\nLet’s start with Vol 1, Issue 1, 1974"

    "section": "Smith (1974)",
    "text": "Smith (1974)\n\nSmith, W. D. (1974). “Editorial”. In: Journal of Black Psychology 1.1, pp. 5-6.\nIt’s interesting to flip through the first issue of journals. For example, I found it interesting to flip through the first issue in volume 1 of Psychological Review, which at the time was the journal for the American Psychological Association.\nIt is obvious when you read the Journal of Black Psychology, that the creation of the journal and new society (the Association of Black Psychologists) was partly motivated by a reaction against the APA. What was the reaction about?\nI’ll consider this briefly from the lens of eugenics. Did you know that the founder of Psychological Review, James McKeen Catell, was a eugenicist? That’s something. It’s part of a deeply disturbing structural foundation of psychology. Some of this foundation is not particularly salient. For example, it’s not easy to find the word eugenic or eugenics in Psychological Review (try to find it using Psycinfo).\n\n\n\n\n\nThat’s curious.\nHowever, if you know who is a eugenicist, because they for example founded the whole thing (e.g., Francis Galton), you can see that several known eugenicists published papers in the first issue of Psychological Review. You just have to connect those dots. TBH, it’s really more of a question of who isn’t a eugenicist in that issue.\nIf you read about eugenics, you learn that eugenicists just want to breed the best people to make society a better place for eternity. They also want to enact negative eugenics on anyone they don’t like, and attempt to eliminate them (e.g., forced sterilizations, Nazi genocide). This is just scratching the surface of the abhorrent practices and ideologies of eugenicists. They talk A LOT about doing this for the betterment of mankind. Their version of betterment is VERY SCARY. Eugenics is also a very complicated and heterogeneous movement that varied over time and place, was widely accepted in society, and often dovetailed with numerous other socially progressive movements.\nIt is very intriguing to read the very first editorial in Psych Review, which is written by an APA president at the time. Sidenote, did you know that between 1892 and 1947, there were 31 APA presidents that were members or leaders of eugenics societies (Yakushko 2019). Have you ever wondered why that is? Or, say how it was that psychology was both created and weaponized by eugenicists to propagate eugenics policies.\nIn any case, I haven’t been able to determine precisely whether George Trumbull Ladd was a eugenicist or not when he wrote the presidential address for APA printed in the first issue of Psych review (Ladd 1894). However, I did read the address. It doesn’t say eugenics anywhere. Ladd talks about three things, in order of most to least controversial. Roughly, 1) stats and methods issues, 2) Psychology as a science issues, and 3) Bettering mankind issues.\nWhen discussing 1 & 2, Ladd acknowledges that there are differences of opinion in the room about these issues. When he gets to issue number 3, he says, “on the third of my three points…no considerable divergence of opinion is to be anticipated here”. I know how to read this room. Devoting the final piece of his address to the pressing need to better society is what it sounds like. A massive dogwhistle to eugenicists. In my opinion, Ladd is pointing out that he knows and the audience knows that they all agree that they are eugenicists. Maybe some of these psychologists weren’t card carrying eugenicists. But, more than enough were, for way to long.\nAlso, the eugenics of white psychologists wasn’t something that disappeared overnight. It hasn’t dissappeared to this day. It became more deeply entrenched in psychology at many levels. Black psychology is partly a revolution against the structures of white racism and eugenics in psychology. And, it is with this context that I truly appreciate reading the first issue in the Journal of Black Psychology. This marks a line in their scholarship announcing their intention to deconstruct white racism in psychology, and also build their own psychology that is not fundamentally a tool for eugenics. Imagine having a psychology that was not used as a tool to wipe people out. It is a brave moment and an honor to read about the Black psychologists who took up this mission."

    "text": "R. Williams (1974)\n\nWilliams, R. (1974). “A History of the Association of Black Psychologists: Early Formation and Development”. In: Journal of Black Psychology 1.1, pp. 9-24.\nI’m not a member of APA and I don’t think I’ve ever been to an APA conference. But, if there was one APA conference I would’ve wanted to see, it would be the 77th meeting in 1969. Read the paper to find out why. The Association of Black Psychologists is an independent psychological society, this is a glimpse of the origin story.\nThis is a rich moment in time, and not being a historian, I’m woefully unequipped to discuss this. One point that I’ll draw out is the issue of testing, that is educational testing.\nFor example, R. Williams (1974) writes that, “ABPsi adopted the following six-point statement on testing:\nThe Association of Black Psychologists fully supports those parents who have chosen to defend their rights by refusing to allow their children and themselves to be subjected to achievement, intelligence, aptitude and performance tests, which have been and are being used to:\n\nLabel black children as uneducable;\nPlace black children in special classes;\nPotentiate inferior education; .\nAssign black children to lower educational tracks than whites:\nDeny black children higher educational opportunities; and\nDestroy positive intellectual growth and development ofblack children.”\n\nAlso, that, “It became increasingly clear as the year progressed that APA did not intend to endorse the moratorium on testing since it had a vested interest in the testing movement. We could not expect the Educational Testing Service to endorse the moratorium either, inasmuch as much of its multimillion-dollar annual budget derives from testing. Neither could we expect the Psychological Corporation (publisher of the Wechsler Intelligence Scales) or Houghton-Mifflin (publisher of the Stanford-Binet) to endorse the testing moratorium. The Black Psychologists decided to move independently of APA. In closing: Charles Thomas has been elected”Honorary Chairman for Life” of ABPsi for his formative pioneer efforts.”\nWhat is the broader context, why did APBsi advocate for a moratorium on testing? First, obviously this form of testing: IQ tests, standardized tests throughout school, SAT, GRE, etc. is abundant in everyday american life right now. As a Canadian growing up I took these provincial tests every 3 years or so. I don’t think we had an SAT, not sure. I took the GRE. I’ve never taken an IQ test. There’s testing everywhere for sure today.\nFull disclosure: I don’t have kids, so I haven’t thought about testing a whole lot. In our doctoral program we’ve recently debated whether we will require the GRE or not for admissions this year. We are doing a trial run of not requiring it. I read emails about pros and cons. I didn’t have much to say really. I was/am on sabbatical, and didn’t put time into the issue. I’ve put some time in now. I will now firmly advocate against requiring GREs ever again. Why? Perhaps, you can guess. Eugenics.\nIf it is not abundantly clear. I despise eugenics. Guess who was behind the organized efforts to test the hell out of schoolchildren everywhere? Eugenicists. Why would they do this? So, they could separate people into desired and undesired groups with pretty science numbers, and then help the desired groups (whites), and hurt the undesired groups, as much as possible. Remember also that eugenicists is another word for many psychologists. I don’t have time here to go into the psychologists responsible for promulgating IQ tests, and then school testing for the purposes of eugenics. But, obviously these horrendous policies impacted the Black community in a profoundly negative way, for a very long time. If Eugenicist psychologists were trying to hurt your children, wouldn’t you call for a moratorium on testing? WHY IS TESTING STILL HAPPENING TODAY?!?!?!?!? This is a moratorium request that has been happening for a while. The Black Psychologists have been leading this movement.\nCan you believe we are only at the first actual article past the editorial?\n\nNOTE: I’m going to be bouncing back and forth a bit, and missing things here and there. It’s a big journal."

Andrews (1976) brought me to tears.\nThis paper is about sexual behavior in Black mentally retarded adults. One of the reasons that this paper brought me tears was to consider what the paper would have said if it wasn’t written by a Black psychologist. For example, can you imagine what a white eugenicist psychologist would say? I can’t imagine a population more vulnerable to the fear and attacks of racists and eugenicists. It’s pretty damn clear they wouldn’t advocate in favor of how to ensure that Black mentally retarded adults have the freedom to enjoy their own expressions of sexuality.

    "text": "Boykin (1977)\n\nBoykin, A. W. (1977). “Experimental Psychology from a Black Perspective: Issues and Examples”. In: Journal of Black Psychology 3.2, pp. 29-49.\nI need to read this paper again. It touches on several issues that are difficult and worth thinking about with respect to experimental psych, and cognition, which I think of as a branch/extension/version of experimental psych.\nNote to self to come back here, erase this sentence, and add thinking.\nBoykin (1977) begins by saying:\n\n\n\n\n\nThis aptly indicates both the content and style of the remaining prose. For content, as the title promises, we will get some reflections on the science/philosophy of experimental psychology, and some ideas specifically about educating Afro-American children. Basic/applied science is a hanging thread throughout.\nAs well, I appreciate the style. All too often I read about the science of psychology in terms of a warped purity ideology. You know the one, “There is only one true science, and only science done correctly by the pure and true scientist can be science.” This is not that. There are no “ultimate answers” here, just a bunch of interesting ideas to think about. Boykin goes on to say:\n\n\n\n\n\nThere’s a lot of context that could be brought into the task of scoping experimental psychology, especially with respect to education. Although Boykin (1977) focuses on links between experimental psych and education, but also on the broader question of whether/how so-called “basic” experimental psychology should be “applied”:\n\n\n\n\n\nBoykin goes on to discuss the empirical research method in terms of usual suspects such as, the role of induction, deduction, determinism/causality, observation/control of regularities in nature, and trust in objective scientists. He presents a argument against the idea that a person can step outside themselves as a dispassionate objective observer, and suggests an alternative notion rooted in African philosophy, that man and nature exist in a relationship of harmonic unity; and from that perspective, self-separation for the purposes of being a neutral observer is an absurdism.\nI’m a practicing cognitive psychologist, and I sometimes have the headspace to think about what I practice at this level. Admittedly, I often do not. At some point I ended up roughly embracing my own version of transcendental realism. At the moment, I’m less worried about the possibility of, limits on, or absurdism of objectivism. I’m more worried about what is sometimes behind the research.\nFor example, in the domain of IQ testing, it is clear that eugenicists had a purpose in using IQ tests. It is also clear that eugenicists were highly organized and deeply infiltrated society with their ideas and policies, especially with respect to this kind of testing. (Acutally, as a sidenote, obviously I am obsessed with eugenics right now, so even though I am ostensibly thinking about what Boykin is saying, I’m also doing that from the lens of other things going on with me right now. So, I totally agree with Boykin about this). In some formal sense, IQ testing is traditionally not apart of experimental psychology, and is more in the vein of differential psychology. So, why am I bringing it up in the context of experimental psychology?\nFirst, I know many modern cognitive psychologists who continue to use IQ tests in their research. TBH, I haven’t had conversations with them about what they are up to. I’ve seen some “discussions” on twitter, and they weren’t pretty. In any case, I suspect most modern psychologists who use IQ tests are not eugenicists. I’m not claiming they are. I further suspect that there are notions about the “neutral” and “objective” nature of scientific tools. For example, one might acknowledge that eugenicists did a bad thing with IQ tests, and then propose that the IQ tests that weren’t bad (they were made with science!), the eugenicists using them were (“IQ tests don’t kill people, eugenecists do?”). Perhaps this argument is easier to swallow with other more “neutral” tests. For example, it’s obvious that IQ tests are biased in numerous ways; for example, see the BITCH-100 test (R. L. Williams 1972).\nNevertheless, the basic ideology is something like tools can never be inherently bad or good, it’s obviously how they are used that make them bad or good. I think some scientists riff on this in terms of motivating basic science. For example, the thinking might be, “I can make any kind of science tool I want, because I am scientist, and this tool will be a science tool, and no one can say if it is bad or good, and I can forget about that question, and I don’t have to take responsibility for my creations, and if I had to think about the ethical implications of research, it would take forever, and someone would find a way to stop me, and then all basic science would be doomed forever.” Sad.\nSo, to return to IQ tests, it seems there is a strategy to legitimize the measure by pointing at it and saying it is science. In my mind it is an act of juxtaposition, and argument by authority. You see, psychologists are scientists, and they made IQ tests, and therefore IQ tests are science, and all science is neutral, objective and true, and worth doing, so therefore we must continue to use IQ tests forever. We are forced to do this because the prime directive of science bends us to its will. Also we see, there are over 100 years of IQ test research. It is the most sciencey thing in all of psychology, how can it be ignored? If you are against IQ research you are against science!\nIn any case, I’m wandering a bit, and about to go get lunch. The what is science debate is often a red-herring. In the context of IQ stuff, I think it’s a distraction from the eugenic purposes of IQ tests. Some better questions are:\n\nWhat are all the ways that IQ tests (and similar tests) have been employed by eugenicists and psychologists to enact, enforce, and maintain eugenic policies.\nHow much of the above is still going today\nWhen in history, have major organizations responsible for, or complicit in, these acts of eugenics taken the step to apologize for their actions, as a first step to repairing the actions.\nIf you as a researcher are continuing to engage in a research domain that is clearly eugenic in origin, or even eugenic adjacent (eugenicists are good at cover stories I think), how are you taking steps to be anti-eugenic in your research.\nIf you are a psychologist, especially one who is not a eugenicist, then you should reflect on whether or not you are doing things that are “accidental eugenics”. That is participating/contributing to a eugenic enterprise that has become structurally a part of modern psychology, even if no one uses those words.\nDon’t be an accidental eugenicist. Maybe get a motivational poster if you have a problems slipping back into accidental eugenicism.\n\nI have more questions, this is a work in progress, I’m going on a lunch break.\nStill need lunch, but I’m trying to put my finger on a thing.\nThere many tools of psychology that have been “touched” by eugenics. Does that mean they are still bad? For example, school testing, and things like gifted school programs were more than “touched” by eugenics, they were explicit eugenics policy. Does that mean they are necessarilly bad? Can you do work in these areas and not be an accidental eugenicist? I don’t know the answer to this question. I do know the answer needs to be concrete and specifically anti-eugenics. It can’t be, “everyone knows X or Y is not for eugenics anymore, it’s just a tool, and look, this tool really does make society a better place…”. Well, that’s what the eugenicists said.\nBack from lunch, AC broke, days went by, and I’ve got off on a tangent.\nBoykin (1977) suggests that the many interests of experimental psychologists (e.g., learning, memory, attention, etc.) ought to find some application in the education of black children. I agree, seems like this basic science should be applied here. At the same time, I don’t think I have any settled opinion on basic/applied science issues in cognition. For example, it’s obvious that there is a tonne of basic cognitive science that is so far away from being applied. Even though coggies use the words learning and memory, and kids use “learning and memory” in school, the concepts of learning and memory as they are strictly meant in the confines of the laboratory are impoverished behond recognition from what goes on in the real-world. My postdoc advisor would sometimes mention that the science of cognition has a timescale of 1 sec, and it’s not hard to see why. I’m not claiming that basic science in this domain can’t ever be applied. I’m saying lots of it can’t right now. Does that mean basic science should stop if it can’t be applied to real problems? I don’t necessarilly think so, the science of cognition is hard. The difficulties of applying basic cognition principles to the classroom is partly evidence of how hard cognition is, and perhaps also evidence of how basic cognition can get carried away with itself.\nA personal note. If I look at some major threads in my own research program, I can see some attempts to balance, or at least connect my basic work with applied work. But, even in my best moments, my work has very scant application. For example, I’ve published extensively on the task of skilled typing. I have used this task because it is convenient to collect performance measures (e.g., precise timing from pressing keys on keyboard), and experts abound. In this work, I’ve been mostly interested in testing general ideas about how learning and memory processes work in the context of acquiring a fairly complex motor skill. This might seem very applied on the surface…however, it couldn’t be further from the applied science of typing. I’ll be the first to admit that I have no scientific idea about what you can do to improve your own typing performance besides practice, practice, practice, but you already knew that. I do think that some of my basic work can be applied here, but I haven’t done that application myself.\nAnyway, Boykin raises questions about basic/applied science in a way that doesn’t also raise panic about the destruction of basic science. Anecdotally, I’ve seen and heard various concerns raised about “applied” science taking over “basic” science. There needs to be both them, and they ought to exist in harmonic unity.\nBoykin is not concerned about the productive nature of the scientific method, only that it be contextualized, and even put to good use within his community. In other words, he spends some time deconstructing some of the objectivity associated with “true blue” experimental psychology. If there was a statue for, “I’m doing experimental psychology, which by its fundamental nature is a value free proposition, and I am just a neutral tool contributing to the great library of knowledge in the sky, I can do no wrong”, it should be knocked down.\nMore important, Boykin does some constructing too. For example, he describes affective and cognition dimensions of developing children, and argues for the inclusion of another dimension: vervacity. What is vervacity? It reminded me of umami. I grew up without the word umami, but I obviously ate things that had it. Umami is good stuff, just like verve. I’ll leave it to Boykin describe behavioral and psychological vervacity. From him, my takeaway was the contrast between how people move and resonate with ascetic classroom environment versus the vervistic environment of the Black church. As Boyking says, maybe school needs more soulfuness.\nFinally, I appreciated the concluding paragraph, if someone didn’t already do this kind of memory experiment, it’s a thesis waiting to happen.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso, note to self, I wonder to what extent the Boykin’s notion of vervacity has been incorporated into theories of embodied cognition. I just did a quick google scholar search. Boykin (1977) has been cited 64 times, I didn’t see any articles from the embodied cognition literature citing Boykin. Too bad, vervacity seems like a concept worth exploring (this was the first I had come across it in psychology)…OK, just came back from google scholar again, this time searching “vervistic”, and there are a bunch of papers using this word and exploring the concept. Very cool! I’d like to learn more about that, but must press on.\nActually, one more thing. In this paper, Boykin does not kick the tires of his vervistic considerations with experiments, so check out Boykin (1982) which does.\n\nI’m coming back to my reading project. This time I’m going to move a little more quickly across the journal."

The data indicate that no apparent relationship exists, a finding that is supportive of McAdoo (1973, 1978) and Rosenberg (1979). McAdoo (1973, 1978) reported Black children holding negative own-race attitudes and positive self-concepts, and concluded that Black children learn to compartmentalize their racial attitudes and prevent them from influencing self-evaluation. The present results raise serious questions concerning the construct validity of instruments employed by previous researchers who utilized racial preference or racial attitude measures to make implications about self-concept or self-esteem (Bunton & Weissbach, 1974; Rice, Ruiz, & Padilla, 1974). Other researchers have also questioned the past methodologies of racial preference research. Gordon (1976) indicated that many researchers utilized preference measures to assess self-concept in Blacks during 1939-1963, leading to much of the low self-concept results. Banks (1976) questioned the ability of many previous preference studies to statistical- ly prove Black preference for White. The present findings are also contrary to the Black self-hatred doctrine&dquo; posed so frequently by many previous social scientists (see Baldwin, 1979) by providing empirical data to negate the belief that Blacks who internalize negative racial group attitudes from the larger White society would inevitably possess negative self-evaluations.”\n\n\nJones, R.

The major danger of segregation indexes is that more school districts may be required by law to use these as measures of racial balance and desegregation. If more school districts are required by law or agree to use segregation indexes to measure racial balance, the heart of the issues of quality education and equal opportunity that constituted the historic Civil Rights movement will be lost; therefore, Black children of America will be denied a quality education.”\n\nSmith, W.

Statistics anxiety has been found to be prevalent among graduate students, being implicated both as a barrier to success in quantitative courses and a barrier to completion of theses and dissertations. To date, it is un- clear whether African American graduate students experience higher levels of statistics anxiety. Thus, the purpose of this study was to compare levels of statis- tics anxiety between African American and Caucasian American graduate stu- dents. A series of t tests revealed that the African American graduate students had higher levels of statistics anxiety than did their Caucasian American coun- terparts. Recommendations for future research are provided. Also, implications for educators responsible for recruiting and retaining African American gradu- ate students are discussed.”\n\nOshodi, J. E.

Dr. Crump is especially interested in mentoring students through the process of completing an undergraduate honor’s thesis in their senior year (see here for departmental requirements). However, students interested in pursuing an honor’s thesis should get lab experience before their final year.\nThe honor’s thesis consists of two semesters of Independent Research (e.g., Psych 5001 and 5002) and culminates in writing a thesis covering the research conducted over the year. The honor’s thesis option is a great opportunity for students interested in pursuing research in a Ph.D. program following undergraduate studies. The honor’s thesis is a major commitment in time and effort for everyone involved, and interested students need to plan ahead.\nStudents who join the lab enroll in research classes so that they receive course credit as they gain research experience in the lab. If you are interested in taking one of the courses, please complete the entry assignment, and then email Dr. Crump about availability. The classes include:\n\nPsych 2001-4 Laboratory Experience (3 credits each)\nPsych 5001-4 Independent Research (3 credits each)\n\nThe Laboratory Experience courses are intended for students who are new to research, and the Independent Research courses are for more senior students (typically completing an honors thesis). They are each one semester long, and involve conducting research in the lab and writing a research report as a final project.\nRecent undergraduate research projects completed in the lab.\n\n2022: Patrick Ihejirika, “Try and forget this image: The role of stimulus duration in directed forgetting for natural scenes”, Undergraduate MARC Honors thesis, Barry Goldwater Scholar\n2019: Mark Rayev, “Deception detection through word usage and word production time in typing”, Undergraduate Macaulay Honors\n2018: Walter Lai, Contributing author on “Instance theory predicts information theory: Episodic uncertainty as a determinant of keystroke dynamics”, currently completing a Masters in Data Science at Southern Methodist University"

The program website describes general information about the program. Students in the program conduct research with a faculty mentor over two years culminating in a thesis. Master’s students in the computational cognition lab will work with Dr. Crump over two years to complete a research project in cognition.\nStudents will learn advanced statistics, data-analysis, and computational modelling skills, and apply them to research questions in cognition. Students will also learn how to create, conduct, and analyze online behavioral experiments. The degree is typically completed in two years, by taking three courses per semester. Each semester one of the courses involves independent reading and research in the lab. In the first semester, students will acquire sub-domain expertise about a cognitive phenomena through an extensive literature review. The literature review will suggest new directions for empirical work. The second semester of independent research will involve proposals for experiments, and collection of pilot data. By, the second year students should have a well-developed research project that will form the basis for their thesis. Master’s student research projects can also be submitted for publication in peer-reviewed journals."

    "text": "Entry Assignment\nIf you’re interested in becoming part of the lab (volunteering, taking a course etc.), the first thing to do is to complete this entry assignment. The assignment consists of writing a small computer program (no previous programming experience necessary, this is an invitation to start learning programming skills).\n\nWhy are we asking you to do this?\nA lot of the activities in the lab involve computer programming: during experiments, the timing, stimulus presentation and key press registration are all controlled by programs we write ourselves. When we analyze the data from the experiments, we again do this in programs, written by us, which take the raw data, calculate things such as averages, display results in graphs, and perform statistical tests.\nThis assignment allows you to demonstrate your interest in this type of activity, and by investing some time in this assignment you can show your commitment to becoming part of the lab.\n\n\nInstructions\nHere is your assignment. By following these steps you will make a website, and then attempt to solve a problem in R. It sounds complicated, but everything you need to get started is right here, by following these steps:\n\nDownload R and R-studio for your computer.\nMake yourself a github account.\nGeneral info about making websites with R Markdown is here, but see next point for downloading an example you can use straight away. https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/rmarkdown_websites.htm\nFollow these steps to get started:\n\nthe repository is here https://github.com/CrumpLab/LabJournalWebsite\nFollow the instructions in the read me file for how to compile the website in R-studio, and then host it on github\nYou can see what the website will look like once you get it up and runnning here https://crumplab.github.io/LabJournalWebsite/index.html\nFollow the instructions inside the source for the website, and by reading the website to get started learning R. For example, in the example website, you can read the journal page, that explains the process. You will see there are some example problems to solve in R, and a link to more problems to solve. I solved the first three, you assignment is to attempt to solve one more problem.\n\nAssuming you got everything up and running, then you can send me an email (mcrump@brooklyn.cuny.edu) introducing yourself. Link to your website that you made, and tell me a little bit about why you want to join the lab and we’ll set up a meeting.\n\nEmail your R-script to Dr. Crump (mcrump@brooklyn.cuny.edu) and request a time to meet about gaining research experience in the lab."

So, I will use 1600x 935 pixels for blog headers. Mastodon does not seem to support “large” image cards, and the image preview is shown in a square. This is a test of an example header I might use with a title containing 10 words or so. The words will be roughly inside an inner square, but the header image will be a 1.71 rectangle.\nThis part is true.\nFrown face: magick has a very nice add border function that does not respect image size, it adds a little bit to the image size, making it annoying to resize. Annoyed face.\nThis code adds a border, but does not expand the image. 16:9 shows equal border in the mastodon preview window. Also, hilariously long.

After making an account over here, I realize this is mostly for tagging .mp3 libraries of existing music so it is easy to upload with tags.\nI could add my own artist info here I guess. Not sure how useful it will be yet for adding metadata around individual tracks I create. It could be very useful, or not. Need to learn more about associating new music audio files I make with all the necessary metadata."

I should consider listing exist discography there. It seems to be mostly for uploading digital music collections, which is not what I’m interested in doing. Funkwhale could be altogether more than I need it for. Still…curious.\n\nRestarted the droplet…waiting through the install.\nGot messed up with the certbot, needed to change the A name record so my subdomain pointed to the droplet."

    "text": "Creating a channel and frustrations\nI spent a couple hours getting the pod up and running on digital ocean, and most of that time was me making little mistakes.\nAfter I got the pod fully up and running I made sure my admin name was NOT my artist name. Then, I made an artist channel to share some tracks. There is a choice between music channels and podcast channels. I’m not planning to do any podcasting here, but the functionality for that looked good (it may integrate with podcasting services for indexing).\nCreating a music channel was easy, and uploading tracks was easy. And, it seemed easy to share the link to the channel so other people could listen to it. I could listen to the tracks, but for a whole day anytime I accessed the funkwhale channel as a “non-logged in” user, I got a spinning wheel. I had to allow unauthenticated users access to the api, and that seemed to have worked? I’m testing right now.\nLast night I almost gave up on this funkwhale thing, but I might persist just a little bit.\nI’m not totally sure what features I’m looking for.\n\nAbility to upload tracks and share them in a playlist\nAbility to get some metrics on listening\nComments or notes per track? Not sure how much I want this feature."
