How do people learn patterns and regularities in their environment? These kinds of questions are investigated using behavioral experiments and computational modeling of cognitive processes. The lab also uses a variety of computational methods and tools to conduct and communicate research.\nCurrent and previous lab members include undergraduate, master’s , doctoral, and postdoctoral researcher associates. If you are interested in human cognition and using computational techniques for theorizing, running experiments, analyzing data, and developing new technologies then you may be interested in joining the team.\nThe lab is located in the Department of Psychology at Brooklyn College of CUNY, and affiliated with the Cognitive and Comparative Psychology Training area of the Psychology Doctoral program at the Graduate Center of CUNY."

After digging around a bit and learning new words like #fediverse and activitypub, I decided to spin up my own instance of mastodon using masto.host. So, now you can find me https://bbs.crumplab.com/@MattCrump, or @MattCrump@bbs.crumplab.com.\nI’m not totally sure why I put myself into my own mastodon instance, but I’ll talk reasons later on. For now, this is an excuse to learn new web stuff while benefiting from a rich social network. Without further ado."

    "text": "Setting up a mastodon instance on masto.host\nI saw Jon Henshaw post about running his own mastodon instance on masto.host, and that seemed interesting, so I tried it:\nhttps://twitter.com/henshaw/status/1587072753034842118\nHere’s what happened.\n\nWent to masto.host.\n\n\n\nI chose the moon plan because it’s just gonna be. But, I noted that it is possible to upgrade and downgrade, so if I wanted to invite more people to my little bbs experiment I could do that. Or, if you are setting this up for a group, it seems pretty easy to grow larger (at least up to 2000 users for 89/month).\n\n\n\nAfter clicking “buy now” there is a decision to use your own domain or subdomain, or a masto.host subdomain.\n\n\nA quick aside for domain names. I have been using R Markdown and more recently Quarto for lots of purposes, including creating this website and blog. All of the source code for compiling this website and blog is in a github repository, and served from github pages. At some point I used namecheap to acquire my domain crumplab.com. This allowed me to serve my website from that domain (there is an option to use your own domain on github pages).\nIn addition, it is possible to add subdomains. For example, I have a jatos server running on digital ocean for online experiments, which has it’s own subdomain on crumplab.com.\nFor mastodon I chose “Your domain”, and came up with the subdomain bbs.crumplab.com as a throwback to the bulletin board services I used to use as a kid.\n\nI don’t have screen shots for some of the next steps, but basically you enter your credit card information. In my case, immediately after purchasing I got a warning from mastodon that bbs.crumplab.com was not found on my DNS servers. Masto.host kindly gives clear instructions on what I needed to do in order to add my subdomain, which involved adding a new cname entry, and waiting for it to propagate.\nAfter masto.host detected my subdomain, it automagically created a new mastodon instance.\n\n\nAnd, when installation was finished it updated to let me know.

For example, if I had the intention of creating an instance that other people could join, the process would be similarly easy, but I expect the realities of doing admin and moderation require a much larger time investment. I don’t have the bandwidth to think about running a larger instance right now, so I’m going to stick to learning the system in this person-sized instance.\n\nAll by myself\nSo far the experience of being “alone” on my own instance is A OK. The default feeds work a little bit differently. My “local” feed is the same as my personal timeline, because no one else is on the instance. My home feed I guess is the same as it would be if I was on a shared instance. I see posts from the people I follow, and I see the things they are boosting. I’m not sure I totally understand what I am seeing on the federated feed, but it appears to be the people I follow, but not what they are boosting. It’s not a fire-hose of posts.\nI still don’t know how to add things to lists.\nAttempting to “micro-blog” with a personal mastodon instance has been rewarding so far, especially to prompt thinking about how I engage with social media in general, and how I curate/save/share what I’m doing. Everything I post on the instance is there, I guess for me to deal with and make decisions about.\nThere is a great deal of topic worth engaging on, and I’m hoping this process can help me navigate my own engagement."

Both approaches work pretty well.\nifontmaker is an ipad app ($7.99). For the price it has some nice features, and it is pretty easy to pencil in all of the character very quickly. It has bezier curves, but the brushes are limited. It is possible to copy in .svg. I liked the kerning feature for letter pairs.\ncalligraphr is a website providing a template to draw characters. I open the template in procreate or adobe fresco and do the characters there. Then, the template is uploaded to calligraphr.com, which converts the font to .otf or .ttf.\nI used https://transfonter.org to convert .ttf to .woff. This should allow the font to be displayed on the web. Let’s find out.\nSidenote: this post is written in R markdown and compiled as a vignette with pkgdown. I add a “web” folder in the vignette folder where I saved the .woff files for the font. These files can be saved to the docs folder if they are declared in the yaml as resource files https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/reference/build_articles.html#external-files.\nMy plan for this paragraph is to write the first letter in squiggligraphy, and all of the rest of the letters in the default font for this post. The rest of this text is just filler text to make this paragraph look like a paragraph. It should have enough words for a few sentences. At least a few. Or, more than a few. Enough for a paragraph.\nNeat. The capital letters from squiggligraphy were not vertically aligned properly, so I had to adjust them in font forge, an open source font editor. I also used font forge to export as .woff and .woff2 for the web.\nTo add the the capital letter i’m using a span, choosing h1 class (from bootstrap 5), and a custom class that sets the font family.

    "text": "Things to know about ChatGPT\nChatGPT is a large language model (LLM) created by a company called OpenAI. Many big tech companies are creating their own versions of this technology. For example, Meta released a model called Galactica AI to the public on November 15th, 2022; and, then shut it down after three days. Microsoft Bing is currently releasing it’s own “chatbot”. Google apparently has one called Bard?\nI happen to have some limited expertise in the science behind large language models. For example, one area of my research involves human semantic cognition and language production. This area of research has a long history of producing computational models attempting to how people understand the meaning of words, and how they produce grammatical sentences.\nPeople have large amounts of language experience. Think about how many words you have heard or read across your entire life. Some theories of language assume that people learn about word meaning gradually through their own personal history of experiencing examples of language. Language is highly structured and not random. This means that words can be predicted based on the context in which they occur.\nIf you read the sentence:\nAfter buying _________ at the grocery store, she squeezed the __________ to make ________ juice.\nBased on the context of the sentence you might infer that the person bought oranges, or some other fruit that can be squeezed to make juice.\nIf you were able to look back at all the sentences and phrases you have ever heard in your life, you would probably find many examples where “oranges” or other fruit words were next to juice, or in the same sentence as words like squeeze, or grocery store. Your experience with co-occurring patterns in language can help you predict words in sentences. This is the basic principle behind large language models.\nLarge language models are not like people. They have been trained on huge corpuses of text (e.g., half a trillion words). There have been ongoing efforts to digitize as much human produced text as possible. The google books project was one of the first. They scanned as many books in the world as they could. We also have the internet where people have produced all kinds of text, both regular language, and computer code. It is possible to download most things on the internet using scraping. For example, you could download all of wikipedia or reddit. That’s a lot of text.\nTo give a bit more history, in 1998 a model called Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) was trained on a much smaller set of text examples called the TASA corpus (37,000 documents, about 10 million words.) That model was able to do some impressive things, such as pass the TOEFL (english language equivalency exam), and even grade essays with similar results as expert graders. However, that model was not able to produce whole sentences or paragraphs that looked like real sentences.\nChatGPT is a filtered version of another model called GPT-3. This model was trained on half a trillion words. Since 1998 there have been advances in computing technology (memory, processor speed, and algorithms), that make it possible to statistically model the patterns of word-occurrence across a huge set of examples. The result is that these models can successfully produce “realistic” looking sentences, paragraphs, and more; all based on the structure of the training examples.\nTo a rough approximation, ChatGPT writes new text based on probabilistic recombination of similar text that it has been trained on. You can give the model example text prompts, and it will generate completions that are similar to the kind of text that has completed those kind of prompts in the training database.\nThere is a really general principle at work here that applies not only to text, but any large set of examples. If you have a large set of examples, it is possible to train a machine learning model to extract the statistical structure from the examples, and then generate new examples that are like the trained examples. This also applies to image generation tools like DALL-E, or Midjourney.\n\nGarbage in - Garbage out\nLLMs have been trained on as much text as possible. Unfortunately, this includes digitized books and propaganda from the past and present that are racist, homophobic, transphobic, mysogynistic, xenophobic, and so on. This also includes hate speech scrawled across internet forums. This also includes conspiracy theories and things that internet trolls say.\nLLMS produce new text that looks like the text it was trained on. It is very common for LLMs to reproduce text that mirrors all of the biases that exist in digitized text. LLMs released to the public are often quickly shut down because they spew so much hot garbage.\nIf you use ChatGPT you may experience toxic text. OpenAI has attempted to solve the problem with a filtering system. For example, the model is capable of generating text that is similar or dissimilar to other text. If you had many examples of toxic hate speech, you could ask the model to generate new text that is NOT like the toxic hate speech examples. The filtering is imperfect.\nThere was a report from TIME magazine on January 18, 2023 that shed some light on how OpenAI made ChatGPT less toxic. The article is OpenAI Used Kenyan Workers on Less Than $2 Per Hour to Make ChatGPT Less Toxic. The strategy was to show Kenyan workers examples of text that “described situations in graphic detail like child sexual abuse, bestiality, murder, suicide, torture, self harm, and incest.” The workers were asked to label whether the text was toxic or not. OpenAI then used the labels in their filtering system in attempt to prevent the model from outputting toxic text.\n\n\nEthical concerns\nThere are numerous concerns about these emerging technologies and widely divergent opinions, ideologies, and interests at play. This is not an exhaustive list.\nIn order for these models to work, they must have huge sets of training examples. Where did the examples come from, and did people who created the examples give permission to these private companies to use them? To what extent are the outputs of these models high-tech plagiarism of stolen intellectual property? Are original content-creators whose training examples were extracted without permission being compensated? Should big tech companies be allowed to “move fast and break things” in this space? What are the harms of this new tech, who is shouldering the burden?\nThe questions around AI ethics abound, and tech company responses to theses issues continue to be controversial. For example, Timnit Gebru is a computer scientist (and AI expert) who was the co-lead of Google’s Ethical Artificial Intelligence team. In 2020, she co-authored a paper called “On the Dangers of Stochastic Parrots: Can Language Models Be Too Big?”. To quote from wikipedia, this paper”covered the risks of very large language models, regarding their environmental and financial costs, inscrutability leading to unknown dangerous biases, the inability of the models to understand the concepts underlying what they learn, and the potential for using them to deceive people.” Timnit was fired (or release according to Google) for refusing to withdraw the paper and scrub names of Google employees from the list. Events like this raise broad questions about how tech companies are meeting or not meeting ethical concerns about their technologies.\nTimnit is the founder of DAIR (Distributed AI Research Institute) which is a “space for independent, community-rooted AI research, free from Big Tech’s pervasive influence”. She continues to advocate and draw attention to major ethicall concerns in this space, among others.\nThere are strange rabbit holes about this emerging technology, investors in the technology, and some of their apparent affiliations and ideologies for society. For example, what does crypto currency, longtermism, affective altruism, big-tech billionaires, technocracy, transhumanism, getting to mars, and artificial intelligence have to do with each other? Like I said, it’s a rabbit hole, and here are a few articles if you are interested:\nhttps://www.salon.com/2022/08/20/understanding-longtermism-why-this-suddenly-influential-philosophy-is-so/\n“Longtermism” and AI: How Our Billionaire Overlords Want to Live Forever\nEffective altruism’s most controversial idea"

To use the service you enter text prompts and ChatGPT returns text outputs. By using the service you are helping OpenAI further train this model, for better or worse. You’re not getting paid, but you’re getting the service for free.\nIn our class we are learning about many topics and writing about them. Here are some ways you could use ChatGPT. Remember, please identify in your work when and how you have used ChatGPT.\nWe need some text to begin with. I’m not comfortable taking someone else’s text and playing around with it in ChatGPT. For example, I could copy/paste paragraphs from our textbook and work with that text. It would probably benefit ChatGPT to have examples from our textbook. At the same time, I think OpenAI should pay the authors a royalty for use and re-use of their fantastic material.\nInstead, I will sacrifice my own writing to ChatGPT. Let’s start with the topic redlining. This was a practice that reinforced segregation in NYC neighborhoods, and is relevant to our class. I’ve been learning about redlining practices from a book called the Color of Law (Rothstein 2017).\nWe are reading about similar topics in our class, and being asked to write about them. Let’s say the assignment was to conduct some research about redlining, and the write a paragraph about redlining in Brooklyn. Based on what I read in the book, I wrote this paragraph:\nRedlining in Brooklyn. By Matt Crump.\n\nRedlining was a real-estate practice from the 1930s that promoted and reinforced segregation between black and white people across cities in America, including Brooklyn. The figure from 1938 shows a map of Brooklyn with areas outlined in red. These same areas were majority Black and poor immigrant neighborhoods, and they were labelled as too risky for government insured mortgages. Based on these maps, mortgage lenders refused to issue mortgages in redlined areas. As a result, Black people were denied opportunities for mortgages to purchase homes in their own neighborhoods during this time period.\nLet’s use the above to show examples of using ChatGPT in the classroom.\n\nCopy-edit your writing\nI entered the prompt:\n\nCan you copy-edit this paragraph for clarity and improved sentence structure?\nRedlining was a real-estate practice from the 1930s that promoted and reinforced segregation between black and white people across cities in America, including Brooklyn. The figure from 1938 shows a map of Brooklyn with areas outlined in red. These same areas were majority Black and poor immigrant neighborhoods, and they were labelled as too risky for government insured mortgages. Based on these maps, mortgage lenders refused to issue mortgages in “redlined” areas. As a result, Black people were denied opportunities for mortgages to purchase homes in their own neighborhoods during this time period.\n\nThis is what ChatGPT returned:\nRedlining was a real estate practice that originated in the 1930s, aimed at promoting and reinforcing segregation between black and white people across American cities, including Brooklyn. A 1938 figure displays a map of Brooklyn with specific areas outlined in red, which were predominantly inhabited by Black and poor immigrant communities. These areas were deemed too risky for government-insured mortgages and were labeled as “redlined” neighborhoods. Due to this designation, mortgage lenders refused to issue mortgages in these areas, thereby depriving black people of the opportunity to purchase homes in their own neighborhoods. As a result, during this time period, they were unable to secure mortgages and suffered from systemic discrimination.\n\nMy assessment: You might get OK results. I like some of the rephrasing, but not others. It made my paragraph longer, and it messed up some subtle details.\n\n\nSummarize into points\nInput:\n\nCan you summarize this paragraph into a few main points?\nRedlining was a real-estate practice from the 1930s that promoted and reinforced segregation between black and white people across cities in America, including Brooklyn. The figure from 1938 shows a map of Brooklyn with areas outlined in red. These same areas were majority Black and poor immigrant neighborhoods, and they were labelled as too risky for government insured mortgages. Based on these maps, mortgage lenders refused to issue mortgages in “redlined” areas. As a result, Black people were denied opportunities for mortgages to purchase homes in their own neighborhoods during this time period.\n\nOutput:\nIn the 1930s, redlining was a real estate practice that encouraged and strengthened segregation between black and white people in cities like Brooklyn. Neighborhoods with Black and poor immigrant residents were identified as “risky” and labeled as “redlined” areas. This designation made it impossible for Black people to secure mortgages to purchase homes in these neighborhoods as lenders refused to offer mortgages in these areas. Consequently, black people were denied the opportunity to purchase homes in their own neighborhoods.\n\nI was expecting it to make point form points, but I guess I should have been more specific with the prompt.\n\n\nWrite a paragraph\nHmmm…what hell ChatGPT.\nIt is of course possible to ask ChatGPT to write the paragraph itself from scratch. Let’s see what it does.\nI entered the prompt:\n\nCan you write a short paragraph explaining the practice of redlining in Brooklyn during the 1930s?\n\nOutput\nDuring the 1930s, redlining was a real estate practice in Brooklyn, New York, that sought to promote and reinforce segregation between black and white people. Neighborhoods with Black and poor immigrant communities were designated as “risky” and labeled as “redlined” areas, making it impossible for Black people to obtain mortgages to purchase homes in these neighborhoods. As a result, they were denied the opportunity to purchase homes in their own communities. Redlining was a discriminatory practice that had a lasting impact on the housing market, contributing to the racial wealth gap that persists in America today\n\nParts of the output are very similar to my original paragraph. In this case ChatGPT seems to be using my own words back at me. Sigh.\n\n\nGet writing advice\nPrompt:\nCan you explain the components of a simple paragraph, and tell me what each what kinds of sentences should go at the beginning, middle and end of a paragraph?\n\nOutput:\nSure! A paragraph is a collection of sentences that focus on a single topic or idea. The three main components of a paragraph are the topic sentence, supporting sentences, and concluding sentence.\n\nTopic Sentence: The topic sentence is usually the first sentence of the paragraph and serves as the main idea or thesis statement. It introduces the topic of the paragraph and tells the reader what the paragraph is going to be about.\nSupporting Sentences: The supporting sentences come after the topic sentence and provide further information and details about the topic. These sentences support the main idea of the paragraph and give evidence or examples to back up the topic sentence.\nConcluding Sentence: The concluding sentence is the final sentence of the paragraph, and it summarizes the main point or idea. It can also provide a transition to the next paragraph.\n\nIn terms of the order of sentences within a paragraph, there isn’t necessarily a strict rule about where each type of sentence should go. However, a good structure to follow is to start with the topic sentence, follow it up with several supporting sentences, and end with a concluding sentence that wraps up the paragraph’s main idea. This structure helps to ensure that the paragraph is well-organized and easy to follow.\n\nAssessment: Not too bad.\n\n\nTurn notes into paragraphs\nLet’s say you had some roughly structured notes, you could ask ChatGPT to help you turn it into a paragraph:\n\nPrompt:\nCan you help me turn these notes into a well-structured paragraph?\n\nEmpire state building details\nbegan construction March 1930 on International worker’s day\ncomplete May 1931 (14 months)\nSome descriptions of the building as marvel of the age\nHad trouble finding tenants (empty state building)\nKing kong helped draw in people and business\n\n\nOutput:\nThe Empire State Building, a marvel of the age, began construction on International Worker’s Day in March 1930. It took only 14 months to complete and opened its doors in May 1931. Despite its impressive size and architectural feats, the building had trouble finding tenants initially, and it was known as the “Empty State Building.” However, the release of the movie “King Kong” in 1933, which featured the giant ape climbing the tower, helped draw in people and business to the iconic skyscraper. Today, the Empire State Building remains one of the most recognizable landmarks in the world.\n\nAssessment: Also not bad. But compare this to the paragraph in the textbook, which is much richer. The textbook is a better standard of excellent writing. Nevertheless, perhaps ChatGPT could be helpful for getting the marbles out of your mouth.\n\n\nUnacceptable use case\nDo not hand in ChatGPT writing as your own writing. This a major breach of trust.\nFor example we recently read a paper reviewing the method of autoethnography. The assignment was to write a reflection about what you learned from the paper.\nYou could enter a prompt like this into ChatGPT:\n\nPrompt:\nCan you summarize some of the interesting features of the method of autoethnography for research in the social sciences, and also contrast them with some of the concerns that critics have raised?\n\nOutput\nAutoethnography is a method of social science research that involves the researcher reflecting on their own personal experiences and using these experiences to analyze broader cultural phenomena. This method is unique in that it places the researcher’s personal experience at the center of the analysis and acknowledges the subjective nature of research. Autoethnography has been praised for its ability to produce rich, nuanced data and to give voice to marginalized communities. However, critics have raised concerns about the subjectivity of the researcher’s interpretation and the potential for bias. They also argue that autoethnography is limited in its ability to produce generalizable findings and can be viewed as self-indulgent or narcissistic. Overall, autoethnography is a valuable approach to social science research, but it requires careful consideration of its limitations and potential biases.\n\nAssessment: This has the appearance of coherence. I find the writing very dry and boring. There are lots little things that are off. Don’t take something like this and hand it in as your own work. We will be giving each other feedback on our writing, and no one wants to waste time giving feedback about how ChatGPT said something.\nUse your best judgment, watch out for hot garbage."

For example, I could cite a paper (Vuorre and Crump 2021), the citation would appear in the text, and a full citation would be printed in a reference section at the end of the document.\nHowever, it’s not so easy to print a full citation in the middle of an R Markdown document, in a style that you want defined by .csl, and with additional stuff you might want like extra links.\nAt least, I couldn’t find a way to do that until this morning, when I came across a life-saver function from stevemisc called print_refs().\nThere’s at least a handful of ways to input a .bib file into R, and then print out a single entry.

In the present experiments, they used the streamed-trial procedure, combined with the method of constant stimuli and a binary classification response, to assess the psychophysics of contingency assessment. This strategy provides a methodology for evaluating whether variations in contingency assessment reflect changes in the participant’s sensitivity to the contingency or changes in the participant’s response bias (or decision criterion). The sign of the contingency (positive or negative), outcome density, and imposition of an explicit payoff structure had little influence on sensitivity to contingencies but did influence the decision criterion.

I’ve been at Brooklyn College for over a decade and haven’t taught my core area very often. Since summer 2021, I’ve been making up for lost time and decided to develop a suite of open educational resources for introductory cognition. I ran the course for the first time last semester. The modality was synchronous online, so students joined me every week for class lectures. I intended to have a textbook chapter for each week of the course, but I didn’t get that far in writing the textbook (note to self, that I need to finish the book).\nIn any case, the format for fall 2021 was fairly standard. I had weekly multiple choice quizzes that I posted on blackboard. I had two midterms and final exam. I gave students a few ways to get extra credit. And, I offered some optional writing assignments for students that wanted to dig into the material a little bit more.\nThe class went off the rails in the middle of the semester. That’s a story for another day, but let’s say an extraordinary amount of unapproved student collaboration occurred. I also learned that I would be teaching the same course in spring 2022 in an asynchronous online format. I knew I wanted to create more interesting assignments for the asynchronous version of the course. So, I made up a bunch of assignments and tested some of them on fall cohort as a second chance to make up for points they may have lost."

    "text": "Planning for the asynchronous online modality\n\n\n\n\n\nAt Brooklyn College we don’t teach during the January intercession, so I had a bunch of time to plan out how I would convert the course from synchronous online to asynchronous online. Ultimately, this involved creating a ton of content, which took a huge amount of effort. I put all of that content into “learning modules” for each week of the course. All of the learning modules are on the course website, and freely available as an open educational resource.\nI structured each learning module into three sections: Read, Watch/Listen, and Engage. The reading section usually linked to a textbook chapter, or any additional readings I wanted to assign. The watch/listen section contained mini-lectures that I recorded and posted YouTube (this part took so much time every week). The engage section contained quizzes and assignments that students could complete each week.\nNow comes the fun part, here’s how I flooded the gates with assignment choice to increase engagement with the course material."

    "text": "Multiple Warp Zones to an A\n\n\n\n\n\nGiven the asynchronous format, I wanted to give students every opportunity to do well in the course. I also wanted to dream up as many ways as I could think of to offer students meaningful ways to engage with the course material. Here’s what I did.\nThere were 12 learning modules and three exams. The grading rubric is below:\n\n\n\nAssignment\nPoints\nTotal\n\n\n\n\n12 Weekly Modules\n5+\nup to 60\n\n\nExtra Credit\nsee above rules\nup to 10*\n\n\nSUPER BONUS\nsee above rules\nup to 40*\n\n\nMidterm 1\n13.33\n13.33\n\n\nMidterm 2\n13.33\n13.33\n\n\nFinal Exam\n13.33\n13.33\n\n\n\n\n100\n\n\n\nThere were three equally weighted exams, making up 40/100 points. The remaining 60/100 points came from any other assignment in the course.\n\nwarp zone 1: Ace the quizzes and exams\n\n\n\n\n\nEach learning module had a quiz worth 5 points and there were 12 learning modules. So, a student could get 100% on all the quizzes for \\(12*5 = 60\\) points. If they also aced the exams, then they could get 100/100 for a perfect A+ score.\nI view this as the standard fare option for getting through an intro survey course (i.e., pass the quizzes and exams). I think many students are familiar with this structure and some may even prefer it over a course with other kinds of assignments and assessment.\nStudents always want to know how they will be tested, so I told them that the quizzes they take each week will prepare them for the tests. The exam questions would be like the quiz questions, and some of the quiz questions might even reappear on the exams. I also let them do each quiz twice and allowed them to take the highest grade. It took a really long time to write pools of questions for every quiz and exam. A really long soul-sucking time. And, now I have a respectable test bank for the course (I wrote it using R/exams, which lets me export to Blackboard and pdf, it’s nifty).\nBut, I don’t think taking a bunch of quizzes and exams about cognition is particularly engaging. Also, I’m the one who wrote all of the questions, and even though I tried really hard to write good questions, I’m not 100% confident that my tests are good tests of what I’m trying to teach. So, it’s not clear how much test grades reflect student performance versus my performance as an instructor. Plus, my whole philosophy on testing is migrating, so I was looking to add more flare.\nI usually require writing in all of my courses, no matter how many students I have. This could be viewed as a form of masochism. For example, I don’t have a TA for my class of 125+ students, and many instructors in my position might not assign writing assignments because they would be overwhelmed by grading.\nAssigning multiple weekly writing assignments for a class that size could be viewed as a form of self-torture, and an over-bearing workload for students.\nBut, I did it anyway\n\n\nwarp zone 2: Everything is optional\n\n\n\n\n\nAs a reminder, students could get up to 60 points from quizzes. The rest of the points came from exams. The second warp zone was to create an alternate way of making up the 60 points. This would give students some choice in how they engaged in course material.\nStudents already had the choice of taking one quiz per week, and they could get all 60 points that way. To increase choice, I added one or two alternative writing assignments to each learning module. This part was way more fun for me in terms of generating what I considered interesting ways to engage in course material.\nFor examples, I made short writing assignments on how to read a primary research article, mental imagery, the APA’s apology to people of color, and many more.\nEach writing assignment was 5 points, just like a quiz. So, each week students could take a quiz, complete a writing assignment, or both.\nI managed the grading by making the assignments short (typically, 100-300 words). I did the grading mostly pass/fail, and students either got full points or not (if they submitted stuff that was way off base). It wasn’t possible to give in-depth feedback on each assignment because of the number of students, but it was possible to give group level feedback.\nNot all of my students routinely did the writing assignments, but when they did them, they were really engaged as measured by how awesome their submissions were.\nIn addition to writing assignments for each learning module, I added on more and more optional assignments. For example, one assignment was to detect and report issues in the textbook I’ve been writing. Perhaps, this was ploy to get students to read the textbook… I also added points for participating in discussion boards, and added more general writing assignments that students could complete by the end of the semester (rather than by the due dates set at the end of each week).\n\n\nWarp zone 3: Extra credit\n\n\n\n\n\nvia GIPHY\n\nAt this point, students can get to 60 points by completing any combination of quizzes or assignments. That’s great. But, they still have to take these three exams for 40 points. And, students always want to know if there are extra credit options.\nLucky for them, I love extra credit. I made two tiers of extra credit. If students got to 60 points by completing quizzes and assignments, then any points over 60 was converted to extra credit. The conversion rule was 5 regular points to 1 extra credit. And, I allowed up to 10 extra credits. So, students could complete 10 additional 5 point assignments and get 10 points added onto their final score for the course. That’s a good dose of extra credit, and can make up for a bad showing on a midterm or final.\nI love extra credit so much, that in the middle of the semester I made an addendum to the syllabus to describe a super bonus level of extra credit. If students actually did so many optional assignments that they got to the max of 10 extra credits, then I basically made the extra credit rain.\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the super bonus level mark I changed the conversion ratio from 5 to 1, to 2.5 to 1, which doubled the amount of extra from 10 points to 20 points; and, I raised the max extra credit to 40 points, which covers the points students needed to receive from exams.\nThis is just a fancy way of saying that students could get an A without passing the exams. They would have to pass lots of optional assignments, but IMO, the assignments I created were much more interesting and deserving of an A than the exams."

The main findings were: (a) the inci dence of cheating among these graduate subjects was found to be at least as extensive as reported in prior studies among undergraduate students?at least eighteen of the forty-five (40%) graduate subjects cheated on the quizzes; (b) pressure to obtain good grades was the main reason subjects felt they cheated in the past; (c) there was a lack of consensus whether certain behaviors constitute cheating; (d) no significant personality differences were found between cheaters and non-cheaters; (e) the MMPI results provided evidence in support of the doctrine of specificity of moral behavior.\n\nBaird Jr, J.

A questionnnaire measuring 7 subject variables and 33 specific behaviors was administered to 200 students. The finding that about 75% of those surveyed had cheated in college was interpreted as supporting an hypothesized trend toward increasing dishonesty. Data on approval and guilt, reasons for cheating, reactions to cheating, and specific techniques were included. It was found that sex, year in shcool, grade point average, academic major, fraternity-sorority membership, and extracurricular participation were significantly related to cheating. The conclusions supported the importance of traditional explanatory variables and suggested an interpretation based on attribution theory.\n\nNuss, E. M. (1984).

This research demonstrates that cheating is prevalent and that some forms of cheating have increased dramatically in the last 30 years. This research also suggests that although both individual and contextual factors influence cheating, contextual factors, such as students’ perceptions of peers’ behavior, are the most powerful influence. In addition, an institution’s academic integrity programs and policies, such as honor codes, can have a significant influence on students’ behavior. Finally, we offer suggestions for managing cheating from students’ and faculty members’ perspectives.\nTable 1 shows Self-Admitted Cheating—Summary Statistics which range from 44 to 82%.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBowers, W.

Last year was the first time I got to teach an intro to cognition course two semesters in a row! Looks like I’m on a roll because I get to teach it again this semester. Additionally, I’m teaching cognition modules for separate doctoral and masters programs, so Fall 2022 is a whole lotta cognition going on.\nTLDR: I’m going to try ungrading my course this semester.

    "text": "Eugenics and the white-washing of psychology\nI started learning more about the social, historical, and political aspects of psychology that were not incorporated into the curriculum that I was trained on. Past me didn’t realize how much of psychology was deeply rooted in eugenics and related systems of oppression. IMO, many of the roots remain buried and not widely discussed in psychology curricula. Sadly, some of the roots are still around. Learning about eugenics/psychology connections has impacted both my research and teaching outlook. In short, when considering how to approach a research or teaching project I have a voice asking “what would a eugenicist do?”, and then, just like Meatloaf, “I won’t do that.”\nThis summer I embarked on a long eugenics and society in general reading project. My reading list is here. All of that reading built up a strong anti-eugenics mood.\nSome highlights very much worth the read for psychologists are Yakushko (2019), and Guthrie (2004). Yakushko’s “Scientific Pollyannaism” covers a wide range of disappointing and deeply problematic aspects of early to modern psychology. Guthrie’s “Even the Rat was white” should have been the default textbook on the history of psychology since it was first published in 1976.\nI have already incorporated aspects of these topics into the content of my cognition course (e.g., chapters on eugenics and IQ testing). But, I have not yet really changed the structure of the course in a way that aims to deconstruct eugenics influences in the classroom. For example, I’m not interested in churning my students through testing and ranking processes inspired by eugenicists. I’d rather participate with my students in a process of engaging in the course material."

I first taught it synchronous online (gave zoom lectures etc.), and then in Spring 2022 I taught in an asynchronous format (recorded lots of YouTube videos). A few months ago I also wrote a post about how I structured the asynchronous course with a buffet of assignment options for students, so they had many ways to get a grade they wanted to achieve. I think the second version of the course with lots of assignment choice was much better for student engagement, and fortunately I didn’t have to deal with any academic integrity issues.\nI’m intending to roll over the successes from the second version into my in-person course this fall, especially all of options for assignment choice.\nI’d also like to avoid major academic integrity issues. One of the outcomes of having a class where most students violated academic integrity principles was that I took a quick dive into the literature on cheating behavior in university. If you teach psychology and are interested in whether your students are cheating or not, I’d recommend reading Jenkins et al. (2022) who estimate that about 75% of students self-report cheating in psych classes. It’s a concern. There’s so many ways to cheat these days, such as paying someone else (contract cheating) to take your course for you or do your assignments (Hollis 2018). Or, getting an AI like GPT-3 to do your writing assignments.\nI’d like to run a course where students would rather engage in the material than violate academic integrity issues."

    "text": "First Class\nI think the first class went OK. At the beginning of class we brainstormed how typical undergraduate courses are structured. We suggested that many courses are 14 weeks long and involve lectures, reading textbooks, midterms and exams, maybe a written paper or two. Students thought that the final exam could be worth anywhere between 5% to 50% of their grade. I asked, “If you could delete one thing from a standard course, what would it be?” The overwhelming answer was to get rid of written papers, and the second most popular was to get rid of exams. To introduce how ungrading would work in this course, I told students I would delete one thing and then I used my dry-erase marker to cross out all of the exams in the course. Then we spent the rest of the first class going over expectations about the course and fielding questions about how ungrading would work.\nThis is my first time ungrading, and I’ll modify things as necessary across the course. I decided to keep close to the course structure I adopted last time. The previous structure involved weekly learning modules, lots of optional assignments to choose from to gain points toward a grade (5 points each), and midterms and a final exam. I’m scrapping the midterms and final exams, and replacing them with self-assessments for goal-setting, goal refinement, and goal evaluation. But, I am keeping all of the optional assignments and adding more. I’m also keeping the points system, but students will be responsible for self-assessing their work and recommending their own points for each assignment. All of the learning modules and assignments are posted on the LMS (Blackboard), and that system can be useful for students to keep track of what they have done or need to do next in the course."

I’m using the portfolio notion in this course as well. At the end of the course students will have created a record of course engagement, in the form of a portfolio. The contents of the portfolio are various: including an attendance record, participation in class online and offline, and all of the written and creative work completed over the semester. The course offers many weekly (and alternative timeframe) assignments that students can complete to engage with learning and add to their portfolio.\nI have planned for three assessments throughout the course. These replace exams that I would normally administer during those class periods. The purpose of the assessments is to support students in creating and meeting learning goals. I’m having the first assessment on the third class of the semester, the second assessment is in the middle of the semester, and the last assessment will occur during the final examination period. The first assessment will be about setting goals for the course. The second assessment will be a mid-semester “self-directed performance review” to check-in with their goals and make course corrections if necessary. The final assessment will be a retrospective and explanation about the portfolio they created across the course. I’m also planning to share the assessment forms with the class weeks in advance so that we can collaboratively edit the questions to make them more useful.\nWith all of this said, I need to draft a first assessment. Will report back."

One thing is for sure, I don’t have time to use Adobe Express to make a header for this blog post. Moving forward, I think I would like the option to have some #rstats generative art code do that for me. That way I can rip into the writing faster.\nAbout a week ago I tried Mastodon. It feels longer ago. I went from joining an instance, to learning about the fediverse, activitypub, and more, to spinning up my own instance using masto.host. So, crumplab.com got a new subdomain: https://bbs.crumplab.com\nAs of right now this instance is closed to new accounts. But, it is possible to view the local feed, showing posts made by accounts inside the instance: bbs.crumplab.com/public. In general, the local feeds of other instances can be viewed in the same way (provided the instance admins approve the option).\nWhen I get time to keep my skill set up to date, I dive in, so I’m happy I happened to have a bit of time to get started with the fediverse. I’m pretty sure all of these tools will become useful for my research and teaching, as well as my students. And, I need to become semi-proficient in the tool set before it becomes usable in the lab and classroom, so I got busy learning the ropes of administering a mastodon instance, as well as operating an account. Much more important was observing and listening to the existing communities on mastodon, for tips and conventions for engaging with the fediverse. I’m very happy to meet such a wide array of engaged people who are stewards of the digital community. It’s been fun watching the migration and learn from others. For example, Danielle Navarro has shared a super helpful overview https://blog.djnavarro.net/posts/2022-11-03_what-i-know-about-mastodon/. I’m seeing a lot of cognition folks, and even CJEP has a mastodon account!"

As I get tooled up, the next step would probably be running the instance on my own server somewhere. The main hassle I’m dealing with as an admin is blocking other instances (see this helpful list if you are looking to block instances: https://github.com/chaossocial/about/blob/master/blocked_instances.md)\nI did not have time to learn how to use the mastodon API, which is very-well documented; so, I was unable to automate the process of blocking instances. There is an older R client for mastodon, and a brand new one in the works called rtoot, which is very exciting. I’ll wait for that one before attempting to automate admin tasks."

I am now me, myself, and I.\n\nMain Alt\nMy main account is @MattCrump@bbs.crumplab.com, link: https://bbs.crumplab.com/@MattCrump. I’ll use this one mostly for general interest and academic related things, and to occasionally boost my other interests in visual and audio mediums.\n\n\nVisual alt\nI enjoy making visual things, so I made an alt for that @MattCrumpLab@bbs.crumplab.com, link: https://bbs.crumplab.com/@MattCrumpLab. I sometimes shared this stuff on twitter, and am currently sharing things on instagram. But, not really into those venues. So, I’m trying out personal decentralization on mastodon. If people want to follow my visual stuff, they can do that, and won’t get spammed (to often :) ) from my main account. Plus, having an account for my visual interests seems to help me focus and curate that interest more finely. It’s fun. There is loads of interest people doing #MastoArt.\n\n\nAudio Alt\nI enjoy making music, so I made an alt for that too @homophony@bbs.crumplab.com, link: https://bbs.crumplab.com/@homophony. I’m very excited for #fediversemusic and #mastomusic.\n\n\nAccount management\nI went from a few social media accounts to more accounts, what I am doing to myself?\nIt seems to me that having multiple accounts is useful and not uncommon on mastodon and the fediverse. The benefit to me is already clear; however, I there was a learning curve to quickly managing multiple accounts. Toot! for ios is very good, it allows me fast access to any account. For example, I log in to all of my accounts AND I log in at the server level. This way I can browse my federated timeline and respond from any account. It works really well. Overall, I’m looking forward to seeing the development of more clients for the fediverse. Given the current migration pattern, I’m optimistic. Regardless, protocols over platforms seems like the way to go, especially for my use cases."

Every year I appreciate the time to decompress from the Fall semester and gear up the Spring. This round I found myself decompressing by playing through Zelda: Breath of the wild on Nintendo switch. I'm a few years late to the platform. It's a great game. Very distracting.\nNow I must undistract myself. I have two new preps coming up for Spring, and it's time make some different recipes (my favorite part of Zelda BOTW is making recipes with ingredients you pick up ❤️). I've previously blogged a bit about courses I'm teaching, and have found the process useful for materializing stories in my head about what I imagine I'm trying to accomplish in the course. I spend a good deal of time imagining course structures, but writing it all down helps to firm up the directions. So, this is one is for me.\nI have two new and very different courses, and I could do a post for each. But, I'll try them together. Both are undergraduate courses. The first course is called \"The people of New York City\", and the second course is called…Ha. This process is already working out. I can never remember formal course names. My go too strategy is to load up my lab webpage and click on the courses tab. In general, for each course I make websites and share out my course materials, and this also makes it easy to find course details quickly. But, I see that I was not as far along as I thought. I have made course websites for both course, but I have not linked to them on my lab webpage. I should go do that, and then come back here to continue the narrative form to-do list.\nBRB.\nOOf, the scary part. I upgraded R and R studio a few weeks ago. I use these and quarto to generate websites, including my lab website. So, will it compile? And, if not, how long will it take. Let's find out…Thankfully I only had to update one library. Not too bad. Let's try this again.\nBut, one more tangent. I'm currently writing this post in notion.so. I think I really like notion. It's fast, fun and functional. I can basically write fast in markdown with bells and whistles. My blog is on my website, and written using quarto. If I want this to be there, then I need copy this into a .qmd document, and set up a new blog post. I was hoping to write mostly in notion and then copy over to quarto later. But, as I was about to start adding external links, I wasn't totally sure how notion markdown and quarto markdown will play together. Let's find out.\nThe link to my lab website that now has my course list is crumplab.com/courses. I'm still writing in notion, and wrote that link as plain text. It is not clickable. But! it is clickable when I copy/pasted it into the visual editor in R studio. Nice.\nWell. I didn’t get a start on verbalizing course structure thoughts, and now I have a meeting. Will be back here tomorrow.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nBache, Stefan Milton, and Hadley Wickham. 2022.

The words will be roughly inside an inner square, but the header image will be a 1.71 rectangle.\nThis part is true.\nFrown face: magick has a very nice add border function that does not respect image size, it adds a little bit to the image size, making it annoying to resize. Annoyed face.\nThis code adds a border, but does not expand the image. 16:9 shows equal border in the mastodon preview window. Also, hilariously long.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Last knit: 2023-06-07\nI’ll probably spend more time on making the banner image for this post than writing it because there’s a looming Brooklyn brunch situation, and I only have a simple suggestion for my future self: unplan your course.\nI’ve planned lots of courses, and I’m about to plan two more for next semester. One of them is a Macaulay Honor’s seminar for undergraduates in the first year of that program. The seminar is called, “The people of New York City”. It’s a really interesting course that has been taught in many different ways across CUNY. It’s also way outside my realm of expertise, which is typical for everyone who is asked to lead this seminar. Needless to say, I have started planning my approach to the seminar. But, I really don’t want the planning to get in the way, so I’m starting to do unplanning as well.\nWhat does unplanning entail? I’m not so sure yet, so I’m slopping down thoughts about what I might mean. Relatedly, this Fall 2022 semester I am trying “ungrading” (Blum 2020) in my intro to cognition course. This approach can mean lots of different things for a classroom, and I’ve been blogging a bit about that over here. One of the things it means to me is that the class becomes a community space inhabited by participating individual learners. From this vantage point, I’ve been working through what it means to deliver my planned course as a member of the community who is very quickly coming up to speed with community wants and needs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBrunch\n\n\n\nBlogging interrupted by a hamburger\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd, I picked up some new records on the walk home, so I get to finish this with some musical inspiration.\n\n\nIn the cognition course I’ve got the planning side of things down. That is, for any class I have lots of pre-planned content and activities that could be done. What I’m becoming more interested in is whether any of the things I planned should be done, especially considering the other possibilities for learning that can be identified together with the rest of the class. Those other possibilities don’t exist before the class, they come into existence with the class. Too much advance planning can easily sideline a class from self-determining their learning process. So, I’m rolling around the term unplanning to make sure I remember not to over plan, and/or to plan for how a community of learners will set, accomplish, and assess their own learning process.\nTo provide a more specific example, I’ll go back to the honor’s seminar course I’m prepping. There will be about 20 first year students in the class. The course topic is stated as “the people of New York City”, and there are lots of ways to learn about the people of NYC across time and place. The topic is easily way too big for a course. One approach I will take as a course leader is to consider how different research methods might be applied to learning about complex topics such as the people of NYC. This fits with another general course goal of exposing students to research methods and digital means of conducting and communicating research. For example, the Macaulay program encourages students to create blogs and websites, and many previous classes have turned their research products into websites as an end-of-semester project.\nPart of my course planning right now involves creating the course website. I’m using quarto to do this (which is the same process I use for this blog and website), and I’m planning to teach my students how to make their own quarto blogs and websites. These will be used throughout the course as a venue to create and share research about the people of NYC.\nWhere does unplanning fit into this? Right now I’m planning to design most elements of a course as I normally would do. I’ll write the whole syllabus and detail out what I expect will happen for each class time, along with readings and assignments. But, I’ll be looking for places where I think it would be more beneficial for the class to fill in the blanks than it would be for me to fill them in.\nFor example, in this class we will likely be completing a mini-project every two weeks or so. Each mini-project will explore using a research method to ask and answer questions about the people of NYC. This structure invites all sorts of questions about motivation for the research: what kinds of questions are worth asking, what kinds of answers are worth knowing about, what kinds of stories are we looking to learn about, what kinds of stories will we tell? I have opinions about all of these things, and I could find readings or draft material to inform my students about these opinions. At the same time, I can unplan this part. For example, I would be much more interested in having the class grapple with issues of motivation, and have them explicate and contexualize their motivations as a part of communicating their projects.\nIn this example, I’d like the class to produce material about their motivations for their research and put it on their website. Or, the whole group can collaborate on statements and content for the course website that reflect the process of self-direction for our learning community.\nUnplanning could be me defining sample question-mark spaces that need filling. Overplanning is me filling the space. Unplanning could be “empty” pages on the course website pointing at issues that need to be addressed by the class before the end of the semester. Answering the question marks, or making new ones and answering them, can be part of the mechanism catalyzing the community to engage with itself and motivate how it steps through a learning process.\nSomehow I accidentally slipped into blogging on a Sunday, and it’s time to go turn over a record.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nBlum, Susan Debra. 2020.

That’s about 750 words times 5000, or 3,750,000 words… or, way more words than I type monthly. Plus, it’s all pay as you go, and it is possible to set spending limits if you don’t want to go over some amount.

    "text": "gptaddin\nI went ahead and created an R package called gptaddin. It has one working function (as of right now).\nRepo: https://github.com/CrumpLab/gptaddin\npkgdown website: https://crumplab.com/gptaddin/\nI’m sharing this in case the development process is useful for other people to make something similar for themselves.\n\nline_editor()\nThe first function I wrote is a basic line editor. I wanted to be able to highlight text within RStudio and send it to an LLM for clarity, flow, and length suggestions.\nHere’s the function:\n\nline_editor &lt;- function(){\n\n  # get selected text\n  selected_text &lt;- rstudioapi::selectionGet()\n\n  # run the api call to openai\n  gpt &lt;- openai::create_chat_completion(\n    model = \"gpt-3.5-turbo\",\n    messages = list(\n      list(\n        \"role\" = \"system\",\n        \"content\" = \"You are an editorial writing assistant. Your task is to edit the content you receive for improved clarity, flow, and reduced word count.\"\n      ),\n      list(\n        \"role\" = \"user\",\n        \"content\" = selected_text$value\n      )\n    )\n  )\n\n  # print the results to the console\n  print(gpt$choices$message.content)\n}\n\nThis function is located in R/addins.R, and it is registered as an addin in inst/rstudio/addins.dcf. The registration text looks like:\n\n\nName: line_editor\nDescription: openai edits text for clarity, flow, and brevity\nBinding: line_editor\nInteractive: false\n\nWith the package installed, I can now see line_editor() in the dropdown menu for Addins in Rstudio. When I select text and run the addin, I get edits suggested by gpt-3.5-turbo printed to the console. For example, I will take the text in this paragraph and run the addin.\n\n“Upon installing the package, line_editor() now appears in the Addins dropdown menu in Rstudio. Selecting text and running the addin produces suggested edits from gpt-3.5-turbo, which are then printed to the console. For instance, I can utilize this addin to edit the text within this paragraph.”\n\nThis seems to work. I guess I should add a message in the console so that it looks like something is happening…Added.\n\n\npoints_to_prose()\nThe purpose of this writing aid is to take a series of point form statements and transform them into prose.\n\npoints_to_prose &lt;- function(){\n\n\n  # get selected text\n  selected_text &lt;- rstudioapi::selectionGet()\n\n  message(\"Submitting query...\")\n\n  # run the api call to openai\n  gpt &lt;- openai::create_chat_completion(\n    model = \"gpt-3.5-turbo\",\n    messages = list(\n      list(\n        \"role\" = \"system\",\n        \"content\" = \"You are a writing assistant. Your task is to take point form notes and convert them into longform prose. Please write in a straightforward and clear manner. The user prompt will contain point form notes.\"\n      ),\n      list(\n        \"role\" = \"user\",\n        \"content\" = selected_text$value\n      )\n    )\n  )\n\n  # print the results to the console\n  print(gpt$choices$message.content)\n}\n\nLet’s test this out. Here are some point form notes:\n\nIntroduce the Computational cognition lab at Brooklyn College\nDescribe lab research interests, which include learning, memory, and attention\nElaborate with a few example questions about cognition that relate to real world issues.\n\nThe longform prose that was generated is below… It’s, well, it said a bunch of stuff I wouldn’t say. Not sure how much I would use this, could also depend on the prompt I’m using. In any case, the basic tool is there as an addin.\n\nThe Computational Cognition Lab at Brooklyn College is dedicated to conducting research on learning, memory, and attention, among other cognitive processes. To achieve its goals, the lab uses a combination of behavioral experiments, computational modeling, and brain imaging techniques. In terms of research interests, the lab focuses on the following questions:\n\nHow does learning occur in real-world settings, and how can we optimize it? The lab uses virtual environments to simulate complex learning scenarios, such as learning how to navigate a new city or operate complex machinery.\nHow do we consolidate memories over time, and how can we improve this process? The lab investigates how information is stored in long-term memory and how we can enhance memory retention through various interventions, such as sleep and mindfulness practices.\nHow do we selectively attend to certain stimuli while filtering out others, and how can we improve this process? The lab examines how attentional processing occurs in the brain, including its neural mechanisms and its impact on real-world decision-making.\n\nOverall, the Computational Cognition Lab at Brooklyn College seeks to contribute to our understanding of how cognitive processes work and how they can be optimized to improve everyday life. By using cutting-edge techniques and exploring real-world questions, the lab hopes to make meaningful contributions to the field of cognitive psychology and beyond.\n\n\n\nsummarize_main_points()\nThis addin should take a paragraph input and return a series of point form notes. I’m going to stop printing out each function that I add to the package (which can be found here https://github.com/CrumpLab/gptaddin/blob/master/R/addins.R). But, I will copy out the prompts I’m using:\nThe prompt for this is:\n“You are a writing assistant. Your task is to summarize input text into clear pointform notes.”\nLet’s try it out on the following paragraph (taken from my lab website):\nThe Computational Cognition Lab at Brooklyn College of CUNY investigates learning, memory, attention, performance, and semantic cognition. We ask questions like how do people learn new skills such as playing an instrument or typing on a keyboard? How does memory work? How do people learn the meaning of words? How do people learn patterns and regularities in their environment? These kinds of questions are investigated using behavioral experiments and computational modeling of cognitive processes. The lab also uses a variety of computational methods and tools to conduct and communicate research.\n\n\nComputational Cognition Lab at Brooklyn College of CUNY studies learning, memory, attention, performance, and semantic cognition.\nLab investigates how people learn new skills, how memory works, how people learn the meaning of words, and how people learn patterns and regularities in their environment.\nResearch conducted using behavioral experiments and computational modeling of cognitive processes.\nLab uses various computational methods and tools to conduct and communicate research.\n\n\n\n\ncompletion_ada()\nThis addin uses the openai::create_completion() function. The model choice is text-ada-001, and the max number of tokens is 256. Highlighted text in the RStudio editor is taken as the prompt, the output is sent to the console.\nI highlighted the following text and used it as a prompt.\n\nPrompt:\nGenerate a description of a five legged cat in 100 words\n\nThis five legged cat is a Reflex cat. He or she isotonically ungrateful and always wants things from others that are unavailable to them. However, the individual is oftenmanent and resourceful when necessary.\n\nHmmmm, not great. This was using the text-ada-001 model.\n\nPrompt:\nDescribe a three legged cat in 50 words\n\nor less\nOne legged cat is a cat that perceptions are two-legged and one half legged cat is a cat that perceptions are three legs long.\n\nMy conclusion is that this model isn’t great for general text completion (or my prompts sucked).\n\n\ncompletion_davinci()\nSame as above but using a slightly more expensive and apparently better text model, text-davinci-003.\n\nTell an engaging story in 100 words or less.\nI had a five legged cat that\n\nI named Logan. I found him outside my childhood home and decided to take care of him. He was always loved and well taken care of but due to his extra leg, he wouldn’t be able to do what other cats could. Despite this, Logan would still try his hardest when chasing down a laser pointer, climbing the curtains, or running around the house. He may have been a bit clumsy but nonetheless, he brought joy to everyone. My parents used to joke that he rubbed that extra leg for luck and he proved them right time and again. He was truly a special cat.\n\nDecent.\n\n\ncompletion_chat()\nThis is like the above, except it uses the gpt-3.5-turbo model. This model works a little bit different in that it handles both a “system” prompt defining the role of the chatbot, and a user prompt. This function defines the system as “you are helpful assistant”. Highlighted text in RStudio is then sent to the chatbot, and the output is returned in the console.\n\nCan you help with some travel plans?\n\nAbsolutely! Where are you planning to travel to and when? Do you need help with transportation, accommodations, activities, or all of the above?\n\nall of the above\n\nI’m sorry, I don’t understand what you mean by “all of the above”. Could you please provide more context or a specific question so I can assist you better?\n\nThis implementation does not include the message history, so the model didn’t know how to interpret the second prompt “all of the above”. It would be possible to add the message context, but I’m not going to do that right now."

    "text": "One of my ongoing projects is an open-educational resource for a survey course in cognitive psychology. The project currently includes a textbook, course website, slides, and assignment suggestions under a creative commons license (CC-BY-SA 4.0). The textbook has nine chapters, and at some point I plan to add a few more. As it stands, when I teach this course, we transition from textbook readings toward reading primary research articles. To supplement and encourage more reading of primary research, I’m considering adding a suggested reading list section to the textbook. The purpose of this blog post is to draft some reading lists, and think about how I would curate and present them.\nI think I have two general problems to solve:\nIdeally, I think I want a zotero folder with sub-folders for different topics in cognition, each full of recommended papers to read. I already use zotero, and it can generate .bib files for each folder, which I can pipe into quarto and print out somewhere. There’s wrinkles though.\nLet me count the ways. Let’s say I have 10-25 recommended articles per chapter. I could put them all in a single .bib file, and then use [nocite](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/footnotes-and-citations.html#including-uncited-items) to print them all to a reference list at the end of a chapter. This will be a long undifferentiated reference list in alphabetical order. I could probably sort it differently with CSL.\nI remembered that I already started an “additional reading” section in the Eugenics and Psychology chapter. I don’t like how it is presently formatted on the page, but I do like that it appears as a section in the chapter. Hmmm.\nRevisiting that chapter I see that I tried two things. First, I wrote a code chunk to automatically generate a reading list from selected .bib entries in a .bib file. But, I guess I didn’t like how that worked out, because I ended up typing out the references directly.\nHere’s a version of the code chunk:\nlibrary(dplyr)\nload_bib &lt;- bib2df::bib2df(file=\"memory_timeline.bib\")\n\nselected_bib &lt;- load_bib %&gt;%\n  filter(BIBTEXKEY %in% c(\n    \"atkinsonHumanMemoryProposed1968\",\n    \"baddeleyWorkingMemory1974\",\n    \"craikLevelsProcessingFramework1972\"))\n\nbib2df::df2bib(selected_bib,file = \"temp.bib\")\n\nstevemisc::print_refs(\"temp.bib\",csl=\"apa-annotated-bibliography.csl\")\nAtkinson, R.

Vuorre and Crump (2021) discussed an R-based approach to creating and sharing research assets in a reproducible manner, and we called it vertical. Since then I have used that approach for most new projects in the lab. However, quarto is the NKOTB, and I’ve been itching to try it for managing assets in a psych research project. And, in the last few days I got the chance to start a project from scratch using quarto, actually several projects. I’m going to digest some of my experiences and lay breadcrumbs for my future self about what I like and am learning so far."

    "text": "The vertical approach\nHere’s an overview of the vertical approach, which uses the R-package template as a starting point for organizing files. This has the benefit of being able to quickly create websites using {pkgdown}. It’s an R-centered approach, which is great for me because I use R for everything. So, if my project includes custom R functions, I can immediately drop them into the R-package template and create an R package for the project. This process can be useful for documenting data from the project too. Additional assets such as experiment script code, posters, manuscripts, etc., are given their own folders. We go into much more depth about vertical in the paper and on the vertical webpage.\n\nUsing vertical for my own projects I gravitated toward following pkgdown guidelines for almost everything. For example, many of the assets I was creating were R Markdown documents. I put those in the vignettes folder, which allows pkgdown to render them automatically. Pkgdown is intended to create websites for R packages and not websites in general, so customizing the website to the needs of particular project can be challenging.\nWhat’s most important to me is adopting an organized and convenient method for creating and sharing assets in a reproducible way. This can be done in many languages, and doesn’t need to be R centric. The same goals can also be accomplished without twisting things like pkgdown into positions they weren’t intended for. Enter quarto."

    "text": "Trying quarto on for size\nQuarto is new, still working out some kinks, but in my experience so far, it’s a mean reproducible document creation machine. And, I heart quarto.\nOver the summer I dabbled with the new quarto book format, and converted my undergraduate statistics textbook from a bs4_book to quarto book. That process was relatively painless, and I was encouraged to try more quarto.\nI often mentor students in the process of learning R for various purposes, and I like to show students how they can make websites and blogs with R Studio, and then use them as a venue to learn R and showcase their work. Blogs and websites were pretty easy before, and they are still very easy with quarto. I had finagled a blog system based on pkgdown rendering vignettes, and after seeing the quarto version I knew I’d make the switch at some point.\nNext semester I’m teaching two courses that will both involve students creating blogs and websites. I was leaning toward using quarto, and now even more so. I have been using a pkgdown approach for building course websites (e.g., like this one for introductory cognition), but after seeing some examples of quarto websites for a course (e.g., like data-science in a box), I decided I needed to try that too (e.g., this emerging course website).\n\nThis week, just before I decided to redo my lab website in quarto, I also tried using quarto for a research project instead of vertical, and that’s what really sold me."

    "text": "Quarto for new research\nI am not sharing this website yet because the project is still in very early stages of development. However, it has been really fun and productive to use quarto from the very beginning of the project.\n\nAt this stage, graduate student Drew Shives and I know our research direction, but we are still doing a lot of reading, combined with stimulus creation, and experiment-idea generation. It’s a lot of creative work that can get messy very fast in terms of keeping track of notes, code, and ideas. This is where I have found using quarto as a personal research organization tool very useful.\nHere’s a quick look at the setup, and why I like it. First, I used R Studio to create a new quarto website project. Then, I modified _quarto.yml as follows:\nproject:\n  type: website\n  output-dir: ../docs/quarto\n\nwebsite:\n  title: \"DRMsource\"\n  navbar:\n    left:\n      - href: index.qmd\n        text: Home\n      - about.qmd\n      - href: ../index.html\n        text: R package\n  sidebar:\n    - title: \"Home\"\n      style: \"floating\"\n      collapse-level: 3\n      align: left\n      contents: auto\n\nformat:\n  html:\n    theme: minty\n    css: styles.css\n    toc: true\n\neditor: visual\nIn quarto 1.2 (pre-release build), there is a really nice feature for auto-generating navigation in the side bar. For example, in the above yaml, under sidebar (which controls the left-side navigation on the webpage), I set the contents option to auto. As a result, the name of any folder in the project will be converted to a section header, and the title of each .qmd inside a folder will be added to navigation list under each section. Here is the current directory structure of the project:\n\nRight now I’m creating things in three different folders: Aims, Design, and Reading. Any .qmd file inside a folder automatically get’s rendered to the website, and listed under sections. I have a .qmd for developing project motivation in the Aims folder, a bunch of .qmds for stimulus generation in the Design folder, and a couple .qmds to keep track of readings in a readings folder.\n\nThis project organization structure may or may not last very long, depending on what happens as we work through the project. Fortunately, it is a snap to change the structure. Just rename the folders, or switch files between folders, and the website automatically updates itself. That’s great.\nLess to do with quarto, and more to do with Rstudio’s new and improved visual editor, I’m super excited about how easy it is to add content in rmd or qmd files. Like it I want to add a screen shot, I take one and drag/drop it onto the text in the visual editor, and it automatically gets added to an images folder. That’s fire. And, zotero integration for easy citing while writing, is more fire.\nSo, hurrah for quarto! And, it’s about to be another Friday night, which means I need to stop writing and hit the render button."

I forked the Hemisphere repo, and am now trying to code my own applets using the hemisphere approach. Using this page to make some notes as I go along.\nI got started messing with O_C yesterday, and made some decent progress (although I don’t really know C++, so it’s slow going).\nI made a copy of the hemisphere source code and am modifying it in my own github repo https://github.com/CrumpLab/O_C-MINERVA. My basic plan is twofold. My overall goal is to start programming essentially weird versions of shift-register/turing machine style sequencers. Ultimately, I have plans to implement some computational models of human memory as eurorack sequencers, in particular Minerva II (Hintzman, 1984, 86, 88). But, to get there I need to learn how to do some more basic stuff.\nMy plan for learning is to systematically re-write my own version of the hemisphere suite to figure out what’s going on, and then hopefully learn enough to start messing with it in musically interesting ways. The rewrite will be way less interesting than what is there already, and will focus on me learning basic operations."

The instructions are clearly laid out on the original O_C site under method B for compiling firmware https://ornament-and-cri.me/firmware/#method_b. There are two methods, and they both word for installing the original or alternative firmwares. Method A involves loading a pre-compiled hex file. Method B compiles from source and then loads. I’m using method B, and in terms of development it works pretty seamlessly (e.g., you can keep the O_C hooked up by usb, and do one-click compile and upload whenever you want).\nYou need three things (links to software on method b link above)\n\ndownload the arduino IDE 1.8.1\ndownload Teensyduino v1.35\nhave a micro-usb cable to connect your computer to the O_C\n\nFirst install the Arduino IDE, then teensyduino, which will ask to install into your arduino app. NOTE: This is where I stupidly ran in a bunch of problems. I confused arduino IDE 1.8.10 for 1.8.1, and spent an hour or two trying to figure out why Teensyduino 1.35 (which is made for Arduino 1.8.1, NOT 1.8.10) wasn’t installing. Yeesh.

I haven’t found any clear documentation anywhere, but I could have easily missed it. The code base is really well thought out, so it almost reads like an instruction manual.\nChysn blogged about developing hemisphere suite, and there are numerous helpful tidbits there. He also has another repository with some tutorials on programming O_C firmware https://github.com/Chysn/O_C_Tutorial1. There is a support forum for hemishpere here https://llllllll.co/t/hemisphere-suite-support/21704.\nWhen you load the hemisphere suite firmware, you will get a bunch of “apps”, including the hemisphere suite. For example, some of the apps are the game Pong, the darkest timeline (cool sequencer), ENIGMA (Turing machine variant), others, and hemisphere.\nSo, depending on what you want to do, you could write another “app” that gets added to this list and/or you could write additional modules/applets for the hemisphere suite (there are memory issues, so have to delete something first). Right now I’m only focusing on modules for the hemisphere suite.\nHemisphere splits the O_C into two sides, and each side can load pretty much any of the applets. So, you could have the BootsNCats module loaded on one side to make kicks and snares, and a two channel euclidean sequencer on the other side controlling the kick and snare. Hemisphere has something like 51 different modules that can be loaded. Each side of hemisphere has one button, one endless encoder (with push), two gate inputs, two cv inputs, and two cv outputs, and half of a small screen for graphics."

The input voltages are digitized, transformed if necessary, and then converted back to analog and sent out. The issue is knowing what range of values you are dealing once they are digitized so you know what kind of math to apply to the signals. Fortunately, a lot of these details are sorted out in the hemisphere and original o_c code base, it just takes some time to figure everything out. This post was helpful for me to think about the conversion issues http://butmostlycrime.blogspot.com/2018/09/pitch-calculation-and-output.html. But, I still think I need to understand these issues more clearly.\nAlso, it’s worth reading the specs on the unit https://ornament-and-cri.me/hardware-basics/.\nSome additional poking around helped me understand some of the structure of hemisphere suite. For example, in hemisphere there is a function In() that will read in cv values from the 0 or 1 (e.g., In(0)) channel. This function is defined in the Offset I/O methods section of HemisphereApplet.h. This file further defines other general hemisphere functions for ins and outs, some which are borrowed from the original firmware codebase. For example, the OC::DAC::set_pitch() function is defined in OC_DAC.h. Also, an inspection of software/o_c_Rev will show there are lots of OC files and various others that are recruited as libraries. So, lot’s of great stuff to work with. But, I haven’t seen any documentation about this, beyond the source code itself."

The hemisphere is already well suited to learning from examples, and all I am doing at the moment is copying and modifying existing applets to try and work out what does what.\nTo be a little bit more programmatic about my learning, and perhaps even be useful to other people wanted to try this out I’ve started a copy of hemisphere called O_C-MINERVA https://github.com/CrumpLab/O_C-MINERVA. My goal is to make a set of really basic applets that serve as working examples of really basic stuff. These applets won’t necessarilly be useful for eurorack purposes, but they should be useful as examples for me to return to when I want to start to doing more complicated things. I often tell my students when they are learning to program that they should go through the motions of programming functions for common statistics like the mean, or standard deviation. It’s a good way to learn about details. So, I will take my own advice and try to program basic applets and see what happens."

    "text": "Basic Applets\n\nPrintCV\nThe first applet I made was PrintCV. The goal here was to make a copy of the boilerplate software/HEM_Boilerplate.ino.txt, rename everything to PrintCV, and then figure out how to do two things.\n\nPass CV from the CV in of a channel to CV out of a channel\nTake the digitized CV input value and print it to the screen\n\nThis little applet is at https://github.com/CrumpLab/O_C-MINERVA/blob/master/software/o_c_REV/HEM_PrintCV.ino\nI’ll point out a few pieces. First, passing CV from in to out happens in the Controller function.\n    /* Run during the interrupt service routine, 16667 times per second */\n    void Controller() {\n      ForEachChannel(ch) {  /* Sends CV Ins to Outs */\n        Out(ch, In(ch));\n      }\n    }\nNote, that ForEachChannel() is defined in HemisphereApplet.h as\n#define ForEachChannel(ch) for(int ch = 0; ch &lt; 2; ch++)\nwhich gives a convenient way to loop over channel one and two. Out() and In() are also defined in HemisphereApplet.h. In this case the ch variable just cycles between 0 and 1, covering both the first and second channel. The Controller() function runs at 16667 time per second, and this is the heart where we apply transformations to the digitized signal from the inputs, and send them back to outputs. I’ll note that the above code is sufficient to allow CV inputs 0 and 1 to pass their signal (unmodified) to the outputs 0 and 1.\nThe other thing I wanted to do was print the value of the incoming CV to the screen. This would help me get a sense of the internal values that I’m working with, and also, a PrintCV function could be a useful way to measure actual CV values, especially offset values that are often static (e.g., precision adder). This part is taken care of in two places:\n    /* Draw the screen */\n    void View() {\n        gfxHeader(applet_name());\n        DrawInterface();\n        // Add other view code as private methods\n    }\nThe DrawInterface() function is defined later in the private methods, there are several existing gfx...() functions for drawing to the screen, some of them located in the Offset graphics methods of HemisphereApplet.h.\nprivate:\n\n  void DrawInterface() {\n    gfxPrint(1, 15, \"1: \");\n    gfxPrintVoltage(In(0));\n    gfxPrint(1, 25, \"2: \");\n    gfxPrintVoltage(In(1));\n  }\nI use gfxPrint() to print character values on different lines (controlled by the second y-value, 15, 25, goes down the screen). The gfxPrintVoltage() function will convert the digitized internal value of a current cv channel input to a cv value ranging between -3 and 5 volts (need to double-check this, it’s supposed to be the range of what the O_C hardware is capable of outputting).\n\n\nCVOffset\nThe point of CVOffset was to figure out how to use the rotary encoder to control a cv out voltage. As of right now this applet works, but doesn’t prevent itself from doing things that might cause problems.\n\nAssign some starting value of 0 that will be sent out when the applet loads\n\n\n    /* Run when the Applet is selected */\n    void Start() {\n      digital_cv = 0;\n    }\n\nHere we constantly send out the value in send_cv, which is defined in private\n\n\n    /* Run during the interrupt service routine, 16667 times per second */\n    void Controller() {\n      Out(0,send_cv);\n    }\n\nOnEncoderMove() returns 1 or -1 depending on direction, so I increment or decrement digital_cv on each turn. Then I use the Proportion() function from HemisphereApplet.h (which also defines HEMISPHERE_MAX_CV), to scale a value in terms of 0 to 100, to a voltage. O_C only outputs -3 to 5 so this function doesn’t attempt to control going over or under.\n\n\n    /* Called when the encoder for this hemisphere is rotated\n     * direction 1 is clockwise\n     * direction -1 is counterclockwise\n     */\n    void OnEncoderMove(int direction) {\n      /* output range is -3V and 6V -4608 ~ 9216*/\n      if(direction == 1) {\n        digital_cv++;\n      } else {\n        digital_cv--;\n      }\n      send_cv = Proportion(digital_cv, 100, HEMISPHERE_MAX_CV);\n    }\n\nI draw some stuff on the screen to see some values and get a sense of the transformations.\n\n\nprivate:\n\n  int digital_cv;\n  int send_cv;\n\n  void DrawInterface() {\n    gfxPrint(1, 15, \"1: \");\n    gfxPrint(1, 25, digital_cv);\n    gfxPrint(1, 35, send_cv);\n    gfxPrint(1, 45, HEMISPHERE_MAX_CV);\n  }\n};\n\n\nLofiAudio\nThe specs suggest that OC can output around 16bit, but it is effectively sampling input at around 1khz. This means that if I send an audio source to a cv in, and listen to the output (e.g., I could use PrintCV which has passes in to out) then I should hear low-fi audio…And, yup that works, super fun. I’m going to use this to make a super simple lofi audio applet, now HEM_LofiAudio.ino. I think I’ll leave this, and mention that hemisphere does some audio input processing examples with the drcrusher and lofitape applets.\n\n\nAttenuate\nHemisphere has AttenuateOffset already. But, I should learn how to make just a plain and simple attenuator. E.g., Take CV in, attenuate it by an encoder value, and send the attenuated value out. I can copy PrintCV and make Attenuate from there using some of the AttenuateOffset code. OK, this works as an attenuator.\n    /* Run when the Applet is selected */\n    void Start() {\n      ForEachChannel(ch) level[ch] = 63;\n    }\n\n    /* Run during the interrupt service routine, 16667 times per second */\n    void Controller() {\n      ForEachChannel(ch)\n      {\n          int signal = Proportion(level[ch], 63, In(ch));\n          signal = constrain(signal, -HEMISPHERE_3V_CV, HEMISPHERE_MAX_CV);\n          Out(ch, signal);\n      }\n    }\n\n    /* Draw the screen */\n    void View() {\n        gfxHeader(applet_name());\n        DrawInterface();\n        // Add other view code as private methods\n    }\n\n    /* Called when the encoder button for this hemisphere is pressed */\n    void OnButtonPress() {\n    }\n\n    /* Called when the encoder for this hemisphere is rotated\n     * direction 1 is clockwise\n     * direction -1 is counterclockwise\n     */\n    void OnEncoderMove(int direction) {\n      ForEachChannel(ch) {\n        level[ch] = constrain(level[ch] + direction, 0, 63);\n      }\n    }\nThe level[2] variable is defined later in private. We find the incredibly useful Proportion() and constrain() functions helping us keep cv values in the ranges we need them in. This basic attenuator shows the math, but doesn’t do anything fancy in terms of channel control. There are two channels here, but the encoder value applies the same amount of attenuation to both channels. To implement separate control of each I would look at the hemisphere AttenuateOffset example.\n\n\nSimpleVCA\nHemisphere already has a VCA algorithm called GatedVCA. I haven’t looked at that yet, and am about to. I thought I should learn how to program a VCA. The point will be to have the level of CV 1 control attenuate a CV 2 input for some output, say output 2. Actually before I do this I should make an attenuator…OK did that above. Onto VCA. Let’s modify by copying Attenuate, and working in some code from GatedVCA.\nThis is pretty much all you need for a simple VCA. CV 1 is a signal input. CV 2 is another CV whose value will control attenuation of CV1, the attenuated output is out 2 (send channel is 1, first is 0). Works like a charm.\n    /* Run during the interrupt service routine, 16667 times per second */\n    void Controller() {\n          int signal = In(0);\n          int amplitude = In(1);\n          int output = ProportionCV(amplitude, signal);\n          output = constrain(output, -HEMISPHERE_MAX_CV, HEMISPHERE_MAX_CV);\n          Out(1, output);\n    }\n\n\nSimpleVCO\nThe outputs are 16 bit I think, and can support some VCO action. The original OC had the bytebeat algorithm which sounded really cool. I should try and make some kind of simple VCO with V/Oct pitch control…OK, tried messing with this, and haven’t completed the task. The VectorLFO applet can go into the audio range. BootsNCats shows another example."

This post will be brief, and I’m mainly using the time to see if I can get the api to work. Let’s go.\nIn a Stroop task (for a review see, MacLeod 1991) participants are asked to respond quickly and accurately to identify stimuli with target and distractor dimensions. In the examples below, each stimulus is a word printed in a color. The target dimension is the ink-color, and the distractor dimension is the word name. The task is to identify the ink-color as quickly and accurately as possible.\nThere are congruent and incongruent item types. Congruent items have matching color and word dimensions (the word BLUE written in blue ink). Incongruent items have mismatching color and word dimensions (the word BLUE written in red ink). The Stroop effect is the finding that responses are usually faster and more accurate for congruent than incongruent items."

    "text": "Who cares if ChatGPT can simulate the Stroop effect?\nI’m not sure. ChatGPT is a large language model, and although I have some familiarity with how I think it works, I don’t know most of the important details…especially compared to the level of detail I’m used to from computational models in cognitive psychology. For this reason, I’m not interested in modeling Stroop performance with ChatGPT for any explanatory purpose.\nBased on messing around with GPT models previously, I’m pretty confident that some series of prompts will produce data in the style of a Stroop experiment.\nWhy do I care about this? Some of my research involves questions about attentional control abilities (Bugg and Crump 2012; Braem et al. 2019), and some of my work uses online methods to collect data. For example, experimental tasks are programmed for web-browsers using tools like JsPsych (De Leeuw 2015), and participants may be recruited from platforms like Amazon’s Mechanical Turk (Crump, McDonnell, and Gureckis 2013). Online methods are useful research tools, but they are not without problems.\nOne of my concerns as a cognitive psychologist interested in human behavior is that participants are actual people completing tasks to the best of their understanding. I’m usually not interested in analyzing data spoofed by a bot.\nI haven’t encountered major issues with bots in the tasks I run. These tasks require quick responses to recognize words and letters. Although it is possible to develop a bot to perform these actions, it wouldn’t be profitable for the bot programmer.\nIn the last few months I’ve run a tasks on Amazon Mechanical Turk and opened them up to a general audience with almost no restrictions. This produced very low quality data and reminded me of several topics discussed in Todd Gureckis’ mturk blog post from a couple years ago. In the section on a nightmare world of human-bot hybrids Todd mentioned commonly available browser plugins that record a person’s interactions with a website and then replay them back. In an online psych study, this could involve completing the task one time (with all of the responses being recorded by the plugin), and then reloading the study under a different user name and completing it again using the previously recorded responses. It seemed to me that some mturk workers were doing this (or similar).\nDuring task debriefing sessions, I use various questions to inquire about participants’ experiences. However, I have recently observed that the responses from some mturk workers resemble those generated by ChatGPT. Notably, I found fewer issues like this when using more restrictive qualifications, such as master worker, over 95% HIT completion rate, and over 200 HITS completed.\nIn the most recent cases where I suspected the data was compromised it was also really easy to tell. For example, accuracy was at chance or, reaction times were way too fast. The strategy of using a browser plugin to record and then replay previous responses doesn’t produce above chance performance when the task randomizes the stimuli when ever the web-page is reloaded.\nIn any case, my question this afternoon was to do a bit of detective work to determine how easy it would be to spoof some Stroop data using ChatGPT. I’m not going to write a browser plugin to automate a GPT-bot capable of spoofing data in the context of browser-based task (say written using JsPsych, or Lab.js, or similar). But, I’m going to test a few prompts and see what kind of fake accuracy and reaction time data will be produced."

Here, Pillsbury uncritically combined past eugenic twin-studies with the new “Army Alpha and Beta” intelligence testing data. Surprisingly, his personal conclusion after thirty-three years of teaching is “that one can never produce intelligence by education, that one must begin much farther back in actually insuring the birth of intelligent people” (p. 46). [p. 525] At this time, however, Pillsbury was just one of many psychologists who accepted such notions (e.g., R. M. Yerkes, Psychological Examination in the United States Army [1921]; W. S.

He was the chief psychological examiner in three army camps.[2] During that time he compiled bar graphs with E.S. Jones that showed the predictive value of group psychological tests.[3] His work persuaded government officials to continue the testing program, which ultimately led military officials to order the recording of data on the national origins of the troops tested.[3] The data collected was used in a way that Hunter did not approve; combining the psychological test scores with the location of where the individual grew up supported the notion of Nordic superiority, which was not his intention.[3]”\nMight be worth reading Hunter’s delayed reaction research in animals and children (Hunter 1917). On the hand, it seems that Yerkes advocated that tests of delayed reaction ability could distinguish humans from infra-humans. And, on the other hand, the results were used in the context of debate about mental representations.\n\n\n\n1932 Walter Richard Miles\n\nhired by Terman at Stanford, trained by Carl Seashore, married a psychologist who studied gifted children.\nA funny story about not getting to meet Pearson on a lab visit https://thepsychologist.bps.org.uk/volume-25/edition-8/looking-back-walter-miles-and-his-grand-tour\nwrote a biography of RM Yerkes.

Journal of Experimental Psychology, 7(1), 67–74. This paper is a good example of value-free science. There is an effort to expand testing in schools beyond IQ tests to include other tests measuring traits that also predict performance…e.g., fill in the gaps that IQ misses in terms of variance explained. However, very little is said about what how these tests would be used in society, even though it is clear from the authors own collegial associations that “better” tests would certainly be put to use for eugenics purposes.\nPoffenberger (1922) This paper is basically full on eugenics without using the word. Poffenberger describes how IQ tests can be used to slot people into professions that they are “suitable” for given their IQ. It is an argument to keep “low IQ workers” in their place as laborers, and given the best jobs to people with high IQ, and to worry about how the economy may collapse if people aren’t slotted in based on their IQ.\nPoffenberger (1930) carries on in the tradition of Galton & Cattell to ask what factors make men of science great. Maintains a thin veneer with respect to avoiding commentary on eugenics.\nHighly relevant account of the activities of the national research council 1919-1933 (division of anthropology & Psychology), wherein it obvious just how many activities were eugenic in nature.

    "text": "First 50 notes\nI need to pause for a bit. I’ve been quickly trying to sketch out some connections between APA presidents and eugenics. Mostly this involves googling their name and eugenics, and pulling the string.\nMy main aim in making these connections is to draw attention to the larger pattern of institutional eugenics within the discipline of Psychology. I am less interested about whether or not specific individuals were “card-carrying” eugenicists, or really truly held eugenics views in their “soul” or not. I think it is enough to establish the pattern and spread of eugenic ideology to consider how eugenics shaped the discipline. For example, I suspect that rampant eugenics had a part to play in systemically limiting the diversity of faculty in Psychology. I suspect it also guided the questions we ask, and continue to ask.\nSo, as a part of reflecting on what I am doing, I drew up a quick spreadsheet of the APP presidents. For the first 50, I gave them each a eugenics score from 0 to 1, with some intermediate scores representing eugenics adjacent work. These are just some rough personal qualitative estimates, to put a number on things. My rough numberization adds up to 34.75 of 50 APA presidents were into eugenics or eugenics adjacent research. Very few were ever explicitly anti-eugenics.\nConsider a sentence like, “It is overwhelming the case that the first 50 years of American Psychology as measured by APA presidents research interests and leadership demonstrate that the discpline of psychology was primarily constructed as arm of the national eugenics movement in the USA”. I just wrote that sentence, and I’m starting to think that I’m not exaggerating."

Adams, Raymond B. Cattell, Francis H. Crick, C. D. Darlington, Charles W. Eriksen, Eric F. Gardner, Quinn McNemar, Eliot Slater, Robert L. Thorndike, Frederick C. Thorne, and Philip E. Vernon; cf. JBA Oxford, G. 14. The activity was at first coordinated by the psychologist Ellis B.

I’ve been wondering about this question the whole time that I’ve learning about eugenics.

When I have time I will extract this section and make a post out of it to keep track of info I’m finding. I’ve discovered the internet archive https://archive.org contains an ample amount of historical eugenics literature, so have been collecting some of it. It’s also interesting to search for indvidual psychologists in this database because all sorts of old textbooks come up. More recently, I’ve started coming across government documents, for example the National Research Council has convened multiple panels to assess the impact of certain practices on society, some of these include eugenics related practices.\n\nUniversity of Alberta, eugenics project in Philosophy department that led to http://eugenicsarchive.ca\nI’ve come across a few department level papers exploring eugenics at Yale, Harvard, need to find them again\nNRC council work: Wigdor, A.

    "text": "History of Psychonomics\nI must confess I am a newbie when it comes to the history of Psychology, and specifically the history of its organizational structure in Canada and in the US. I’ve learned a couple things so far. E. G. Boring (1928 APA president) is often credited with starting the History of Psychology. When I read Boring, I find he doesn’t do a good job of contextualizing the history of Psychology in terms of eugenics. I wonder why (I have my suspicions), he certainly worked with and knew a whole bunch of eugenicist psychologists, and it is incredible to believe that he didn’t know about the ideologies of his colleagues. Maybe he thought the eugenics part was so obvious it went without saying…or maybe not.\nAs I write this I’m aware that I haven’t read all of the History of Psych journals, so I don’t know whether or how they reconstruct the history of Psychology from the lens of eugenics. Need to read more about this for myself.\nThere is a tradition in American Psychology of breaking away from the APA (American Psychological Association). The more I learn about the APA, the more I understand why. Psychonomics broke away from the APA, and before looking at that, I wanted to juxtapose the formation of Psychonomics with the formation of another society, The Association of Black Psychology who has been publishing the Journal of Black Psychology since 1974. The ABPsi broke from the APA and in the last half-century have constructed an entire new field in Psychology that is notable for several reasons, including the pursuit of restorative justice for the actions of white racist and eugenicist psychologists against the Black Community. So, I wonder if Psychonomics broke away from the APA for any related reasons…(edit: not so much)."

    "section": "The founding of Psychonomic Society",
    "text": "The founding of Psychonomic Society\nOK, back to the first paper on the history of Psychonomics. This one is titled, “The founding of the Psychonomics society” (Dewsbury and Bolles 1995). Before I go through it, it’s worth reminding myself (I used to be a history major) what I learned about “history” in undergrad.\nThere is opinion and perspective in historical retelling. So I need to wonder, what lens is used here to discuss the beginnings of Psychonomics?\nHistorical retellings often use the same kinds of tricks. For example, Wilson (n.d.) refers to Ebbinghaus’ quip that “psychology has a long past, but only a short history”. Wilson uses this quip to point out a common narrative structure in historical retelling. In histories of psychology as a science we see the “long” pointers back to the early Greek philosophers. It is often the case that “long” pointing is a way of using juxtaposition to connect some current issue with the significance or value of “well-accepted” historical figures. E.g., psychology continues in the supremely wonderful and great tradition of the righteous and true great traditions of the past…That kind of thing.\nI’ll have an eye out for the “long” pointers as I “read between the lines” of the “The founding of Psychonomics”. Let’s go.\nHere’s the first bit of the paper:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTLDR, the Psychonomics origin story begins with a bunch of white dudes at a bar. I can totally relate to that, because that is pretty much what my experience is like when I go to Psychonomics.\nWe learn that this meet-up was at an AAAS meeting (American Association for the Advancement of Science). Now, far be it from me to criticize the AAAS. And, I have not looked too closely at this organization yet. Suffice it to say, let me connect the AAAS with an important person in its history, James McKeen Cattell. Cattell is a notable eugenicist, as well he was an APA president, and he founded Psychological Review, and he bought Science and edited it for 50 years. I haven’t read this paper yet, but it apparently covers some of the eugenics aspects of AAAS (Farber 2008).\nOK, so some AAAS affiliated Psychologists go to a bar…and two years later Psychonomics was born. Some of those psychologists were “Clarence Graham of Columbia University, Clifford T. Morgan of Johns Hopkins, S. S. Stevens of Harvard, and William S. Verplanck of Hunter College.” I start looking at the scholarship of the organizers further down.\nSo, after the origin story, the founding of Pscyhonomics is set in context of the tradition of splintering off from APA, which many other groups do for various reasons.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe are pulled back to into the living room of G. Stanley Hall in 1892, at the dawn of the APA. I would say that Hall was deeply into eugenics, for some connections see.\nI think it is also fair to say that the first presidential address published in the first issue of Psych Review in 1894 by George Trumball Ladd (2nd APA president, also frequent contributor to the Journal of Race Development…) was about establishing the place of psychology in Science. From the very beginning the eugenicists involved in Psychology were very eager to establish and maintain the scientific purity of Psychology. This a theme that sometimes is used to give psychologists cover to conduct “science” in a “value-free”, “objectively neutral” way (see Yakushko (2019a) on scientism). FYI, I also think that Ladd was dog-whistling to the eugenicists in the crowd in his final thoughts about using psychology for the betterment of society. It is also highly interesting to inspect the first issue of Psych Review for known eugenicists (e.g., Francis Galton, founder of eugenics, publishes on his ability to arithmetic by smell).\nNext, we learn about some previous splits within the APA.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWould you be surprised if Leta Hollingworth was a racist and eugenicist? See here wikipedia page. She was also married to another eugenicist psychologist Harry Levi Hollingworth, who was president of the APA in 1927. You could read Wallin’s eugenics here (Wallin 1914). This split didn’t last long and the APA recouped the AACP, and established the first “section” in the APA. Neato, I didn’t know that.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is an acknowledgement of the role that WW II played in the discipline of psychology. There are many connections between psychologists and war efforts in the US, and without going into that history, let me point out a primary theme is eugenics, and many of the psychologists involved were also members of eugenics societies. We see some mention of some other societies, like SEP (Society of Experimental Psychologists)…notably this exclusive honor club of psychologists still gives the Howard Crosby Warren medal every year. HC Warren was another APA president (1913), and he is listed in the Eugenical News as an active researcher. But, the main point of this paragraph is the italicized two words “and practice”, whereby the new bylaws of the APA included “practice” alongside science, as a way into the APA. It seems like the scientists didn’t like this very much. They didn’t want the science to be watered down. I get that.\nWe are then treated to a context of previous attempts to make scientific clubs of psychologists, where psychologists could just finally hang out and be scientists with each other.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe experimentalists were notable misogynists, and they grew into the SEP, which maintained its misogynistic roots. I won’t go into the membership of SEP, because this about Psychonomics, and SEP is another day.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPart of the point in this history could be to establish the “long” roots of Psychonomics by tying it to preceding exclusive honor societies. There is much cross-fertilization between the societies, as noted throughout this paper (and even today).\nNext, we learn about earlier efforts by Titchener’s group to create scientific space within APA conferences of the 20s.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI haven’t found Titchener connect himself with eugenics in his writing, but Boring is certainly eugenics adjacent (having with worked with Yerkes in the army IQ testing effort). Dallenbach and Fernberger I don’t know much about. Dallenbach was on an NRC committee with several other known eugenics proponents. Fernberger wrote a biography for HC Warren, wrote on “the problem of mental disorders”, and seems eugenics adjacent at first glance. J. E. Anderson was APA president in 1943, and wrote “The Modern baby Book and Child Development Record”, which follows in the footsteps of Galton’s eugenics approach. Raymond Dodge was APA president in 1916, did some IQ testing during the war, and supported some eugenics policies, but doesn’t appear to be a major public advocate of eugenics. Haven’t looked into Robinson, but he writes about the great need to apply science to “the problem of public intelligence”. Shepard like many his contemporaries worked in testing of the military during the war.\nIt seems that this effort of organization didn’t really work, and the group fizzled.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut, it’s interesting that very notable people (“stalwarts”) were in attendance: Harvey Carr, Clark Hull, Joseph Jastrow, H. C. Warren, and Robert S. Woodworth. T. All of these men were deeply into eugenics, and they were also all one-time presidents of the APA see some notes on each here.\nHuh, next we learn about another fascinating society in Psychology, the psychological round table, or PRT…If you followed my twitter account last summer, you would know that I tweeted a bunch about them. They are a “well-kept-secret” honor society that still exists today. They have a smelly history of misogyny. They keep their member list close to their chests. Who knows what their members think about eugenics? It’s just one of those questions that has to be asked in a blog post using the lens of eugenics to explore this paper.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI think the TLDR here is that Psychonomics should be proud that among its founders were esteemed members of PRT. Congrats, give yourself a pat on the back.\nPRT had GUV as a sister “secret society”, so ya. Hi GUV friends, wave.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAgain we have a list of names of well known psychologists. I’ll point to one small puzzle. I know C. W. Eriksen because he invented the flanker task. I’ve been asking myself, what does that have to do with eugenics? After all, I have used that task on numerous occasions. Well, the puzzle is not about the flanker task. Nope, it is why does C. W. Eriksen appear in a footnote in Kuhl’s (Kühl 2013) book on eugenics? It’s because Eriksen was among several other psychologists (with eugenics connections) who signed a letter supporting Arthur Jensen, who has often been characterized as a racist psychologist.\nfrom Kuhl: “The ten other scholars were Jack A. Adams, Raymond B. Cattell, Francis H. Crick, C. D. Darlington, Charles W. Eriksen, Eric F. Gardner, Quinn McNemar, Eliot Slater, Robert L. Thorndike, Frederick C. Thorne, and Philip E. Vernon; cf. JBA Oxford, G. 14. The activity was at first coordinated by the psychologist Ellis B. Page of the University of Connecticut; cf. Jensen to Dobzhansky, 9/2/1972, THA Philadelphia: Jensen, Arthur R.”\nAnyway, let’s continue with the paper.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInteresting, I did not know that there was a failed attempt to remove division 3 (exp in psych) from APA in 1948. But, I certainly have learned about big names in Experimental Psychology who were eugenicists, like Thorndike, Watson and Lashley. I haven’t looked at Spence or Graham. For Spence I will just point out that we worked under Yerkes and Hull, so it seems very likely he was exposed to his mentors’ eugenics. It would be interesting to look at Spence’s scholarship from the lens of the eugenics ideology of his mentors. (edit: I do that a bit later).\nAlright, we have arrived at the beginning of the Psychonomics Society:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s take a look at the table events:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore names:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd a table of membership of the organizing committee (from the American Men of Science):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInteresting to note the ages, so many members were all kicked out of PRT and GUV.\nMore people get involved. I love how “diverse” and “white males” was working into the paragraph.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere was some discussion and dissent about the purposes and directions of the new society. I wonder how much of that discussion had to do with restorative justice for survivors of eugenics at that time. I wasn’t there, maybe it wasn’t on the radar.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSome of the tension in the story appears to be the need to fight for science in psychology, and to make a society that shows everyone why science and psychology is so important. A story like this has been drilled into me over the years. IMO, science shouldn’t be an excuse to do psychology.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd now, we go back to the bar:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShould I go to Appendix D now, or later…it’s choose your own adventure. Let’s do it, Appendix D says :\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor my two cents, the part at the bottom resonates very strongly. It seems there was an elitist contingent from the PRT. Ever wonder why graduate students don’t give talks at Psychonomics? Maybe this is why. The elitists won.\nBack to the paper. So, 950 invitations were sent out to potential members, the name Psychonomics was adopted and incorporated in 1960. There is an appendix on the name “Psychonomics”. I’ll get to that later.\n“The First Annual Scientific Meeting of the Psychonomic Society The first meeting of the Psychonomic Society was held at the University of Chicago on September 1-3, 1960, just before the 1960 APA meetings. Approximately 294 individuals attended, of whom 195were members, 79 were guests, and approximately 20 were unregistered. The program included 119 papers in 24 sessions arranged in eight time blocks with three concurrent sessions each; four blocks on Thursday, three blocks and an afternoon business meeting on Friday, and one block on Saturday morning. They were grouped into 15 categories. The nature of the experimental psychology ofthe time, at least for the members of the new Psychonomic Society, can be seen in the distribution of papers across sessions; these are presented in Table 3.”\nLet’s look at Table 3:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOh no, it seems that the potpourri session has basically disappeared in terms of modern Psychonomics. Now, should I stay or should I go find the 1960 conference abstracts. I guess I should do that. I’m going to do that now, wish me luck.\nNo dice yet, couldn’t find the conference abstracts after a quick search. Not sure which archive they are in. In any case, it would be interesting read about the genetics session and a few others.\nWell, maybe spoke to soon. I can do things like search “paper presented to the Psychonomic Society, 2 September 1960” in Google scholar, and restrict the dates to 1960. Then a few papers that were read at psychonomics in 1960 come up. A start anyway. Here’s an example, still would be nice to get the full list at some point.\n\nJerison, H. J. (1961). Quantitative analysis of evolution of the brain in mammals. Science, 133(3457), 1012-1014.\n\nAlright, some stuff happened at the first conference. We learn that it wasn’t really too much different than division 3 APA conferences. Then there is the first business meeting, a first newsletter, etc.\nSome thorns in the side, or additional reasons why Psychonomics needed to be created, it seems APA was making actual presentations of research more difficult. Kind of funny to imagine Estes’ apparatus solution to the problem.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt seems that Psychonomics could be the place where science happened, and still be affiliated with the APA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat’s in a name…Also, more in the appendix, which I will get to later. Also, some icky quotes in here…what’s on page 5 !!!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSome membership features:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI guess this part went out the window, said the fellow researching the foundations of the fellow-less society he is a fellow of.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere was a distinct lack of diversity:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo this is why Psychonomics is just about coffee…keeps the cost of the conference down though (and I very much appreciate that…Also, I should say I very much appreciate Psychonomics, and the only reason I am spending this much time looking into the history of Psychonomics is because of how much I appreciate this society.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen some more stuff about restricting papers and talks to members. LET THE GRADUATE STUDENTS GIVE TALKS ALREADY.\nGovernance structure is supposedly lean and in the style of PRT…not sure if that is good or bad. I’ve never been involved with governance at Psychonomics. Can’t say anything about what it’s like now.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPsychonomics journals didn’t work out right away, but eventually started happening, courtesy of Clifford Morgan.\nThe concluding paragraph.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo a simple history of Psychonomics is that it is a lean organization for scientific psychologists to talk about their science. And it is does that very well.\nSocieties have many members and viewpoints and it’s unclear what kinds of views Psychonomics members have had over time about issues such as eugenics, or about tolerating or not tolerating other members’ views on such issues.\n\nTime for a small break.\nAside from eugenics, I wonder how many folks from the governing board of Psychonomics and say all of the journals are also members of PRT and GUV? I would guess quite a few. If so, there is a “hidden” layer of elitism to the society, and if you are not part of the club…like moi, then I guess sucks to be you (or me as it happens)."

    "text": "Naming Psychonomics\nOn the naming of Psychonomics from the appendix:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI’ll point out that James Mark Baldwin also wrote, “The mental development in the child and race: methods and processes (Baldwin, 1900)”. And, that curiously the word “flow” is often used in eugenics literature (see chpt 6 of Yakushko (2019a)). These are obviously juxtaposition to eugenics, and I don’t know the eugenics literature well enough yet to know if there are additional connections. Anyway, I thought these connections were worth noting.\nThe rest of the appendix reads:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI’ve had a little bit more time to look at “Psychonomic” in the context of eugenics and social darwinism, and I found that it also has a meaning in terms of the “general psychonomic law”. I found this in a footnote from Goodchild (2012) who discusses G. Stanley Hall (one-time APA president and eugenicist)\n“Cremin, Transformation of the School, 101–2. Cremin described Hall’s foundational idea exceptionally well.”Hall’s basic thesis—the ‘general psychonomic law,’ which he borrowed from Haeckel and Spencer—was that ontogeny, the development of the indi- vidual organism, recapitulates phylogeny, the evolution of the race.”\nI dunno, seems like the general psychonomic law also has a meaning in terms of eugenics writing. Or maybe I’m just reading way too much into this. Here’s Hall in his own words…\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYup, psychonomics is a word that also has meaning in eugenics writing. So, there’s that.\nA final thought on this is the historical tradition of harkening back to something of perceived value. Is it possible that in establishing a new society, the founders chose the word “Psychonomics” to harken back to the beginning of the APA, and reference the eugenics writings of the first APA president, G. Stanley Hall? It’s a question that falls out of the eugenic analysis lens.\n\nThere are three more papers on the history of Psychonomics on their website, and I’ll read those a little bit later. Some of the next steps that I should take include looking more closely at the scholarship of the organizers. Considering the large amount of eugenics oriented research in the APA up to this time, and considering that Psychonomics was mainly planning to be a society that continued APA division 3 research, it would be surprising if the early days of Psychonomics did not include eugenics oriented research.\nAt the same time, we are now talking about 1960 and onward, a time in history when it became more unpopular to use the word eugenics (often attributed to widespread public rejection of eugenics following revelations of Nazi war crimes), and to talk openly about promoting eugenics. So, unlike pre 1945 where it was rather easy to line up psychologists who published in psychology and eugenics journals, or otherwise self-identified as being a eugenicist, it seems like more of a challenge to determine whether psychologists in the 60s were involved in eugenics.\nBefore I start to look more closely at the scholarship of organizing members, I’d like to mention a few points of interest. For myself, I have been wondering about the connections between eugenics and the cognitive revolution. Psychonomics appears right in the same time frame as the cognitive revolution. I have spent many years thinking about cognition, and basically never thought of myself as contributing in anyway to programs of eugenics. I’ve been asking basic questions about basic psychological processes. How is that related to eugenics?\nIn any case, here are a few tidbits that have started to inform my thinking about the cognitive revolution. First, it is obvious that the history of individual differences psychology is tightly interwoven with eugenics. The development of IQ testing and psychometrics were employed as tools of eugenics many times over in many different venues in society. It was less obvious to me how experimental psychology was involved. One way was that many formative psychologists in experimental psychology were eugenicists, Thorndike, Watson, Lashley, Hull…the list goes on.\nAt one point I jumped ahead of myself (in terms of going through the APA presidents), and I looked George A. Miller & eugenics. Most of us know Miller for his magic number 7 + or - 2 paper. That paper was also about applying ideas from Claude Shannon’s information theory to information processing limitations in psychology. Well, guess where Claude Shannon did his master’s thesis. At the eugenics record office in Cold Springs Harbor (Long Island New York). This is one of those weird eugenics connections.\nIt took some googling but eventually I found George Miller explain his version of eugenics in 1967 in Miller (1967). Miller inverts a common fear of morons that eugenicists usually foment about. Eugenicists like H. Goddard (Goddard 1927) exclaim that morons are everywhere, they look like everyone else, but they are morons because of their IQ, and they must be removed from society or else society will collapse. Miller, in his futurism about the year 2000, says the society will become too complex rendering everyone morons, so basically we need to do something about it or else. Miller cryptically talks about when “the day comes that we have the necessary facts to support a realistic eugenics program, such information could be valuable.” Miller doesn’t say who he wishes to eliminate, he’s cryptic. Still, he thanks his buddy R.J. Hernnstein at the beginning, probably for all the chats about eugenics (Hernnstein would later publish “the Bell curve”).\nStill, what did this have to do with cognition? Well, Miller also explains how it obvious that information processing capacity needs to be increased in order for society to survive. It’s plain old Intelligence-exalting, fear-mongering, Galtonian eugenics with fancy words. So, there is some ideology between Miller’s magic number. And it apparently has to do with eugenics.\nSecond, although I still have to confirm this, it appears that Abraham Maslow was deeply into eugenics, but only wrote about it privately, and this was only made generally available to public upon publishing of some of his private notes.\nI mention these two examples primarily because it may be difficult to suss out eugenic ideology among psychologists who don’t share their views publicly, but continue nevertheless to conduct science that has eugenic implications. So, it’s a bit of a warning to myself to not get carried away with wondering if someone is really a eugenicist or not. It’s not for me to decide. One of primary aims is to document more clearly the structural eugenics aspects. In other words, I think at some point it will become clear enough that there was a bunch of eugenics going on, and that this shaped our discipline, and if this is true, it is something Psychonomics has to deal with."

Let’s take a look.\nAlso, what follows are personal notes, sometimes interspersed with “maybe” eugenic-adjacent things, sometimes things I’m interested in returning to for other reasons. After all, even though I have an interest in learning about psychology from the lens of eugenics, this is likewise an opportunity for me to learn about people I didn’t know about before.\n\nWendell R. Garner\n\nHad a meeting following SEP that was important for starting up Psychonomics\nSidenote, I always enjoyed reading Garner’s ideas, especially inferred subsets.\nGarner was the James Rowland Angell Professor of Psychology at Yale, Angell of course was a eugenicist, so even if Garner wasn’t he had to deal with this association.

He deemed a general intelligence test “the single most important test that can be administered for vocational guidance purposes” (Humphreys, 1985, p. 211). He also coined the concept “inadequate learning syndrome” (ILS) and argued it was a more important social problem than the AIDS epidemic (Humphreys, 1988).\nAmid the controversy generated by publication of The Bell Curve in 1994, Humphreys wrote a target article (Humphreys, 1994), which stimulated a series of comments by a number of prominent scholars in the field. He generated further controversy by accepting funding from the Pioneer Fund. He was also one of 52 signatories on “Mainstream Science on Intelligence,[3]” an editorial written by Linda Gottfredson and published in the Wall Street Journal, which defended the findings on intelligence in The Bell Curve.\nHumphreys, L.

He was the author of the 1943 textbook Physiological Psychology, as well as a co-founder of the Psychonomic Society in 1959, of which he served as the first chairman.[2][3] He also established three academic journals from 1964 to 1966: Psychonomic Science, Psychonomic Monograph Supplements, and Perception & Psychophysics. He went on to give these journals to the Psychonomic Society in 1967.[4] In his honor, the Society for Behavioral Neuroscience and Comparative Psychology, Division 6 of the American Psychological Association, awards the Clifford T.

    "text": "Psychonomic Journals\nThe second paper on the history of Psychonomics discusses the journals and issues around publishing them. Some interesting stories about the publishing side of things. (Dewsbury 1996)\n\nPsychonomic Science\nRunning out of steam a bit. I’ve perused a bit through the journal Psychonomic Science, which runs from 1964 to 1972. There are a smattering of papers that are eugenics adjacent IMO, but it mostly seems like fairly standard Psychonomics fare. It’s really great most of these papers are open access, I love this about Psychonomics. The journal also publishes some of the abstracts from Psychonomics conferences. I took a quick look at a few of them, and didn’t see any more papers with eugenics in the title like this Cleland, Swartz, and McGavern (1979), which seems like a rarity. Also, the word “eugenic” and “eugenics” return no results from the journal.\n\n\nPsychonomic Monograph Supplements\nFor whatever reason I didn’t have an easy time searching the table of context of Psychonomic monograph supplements. It seems that Springer does not index this one?\n\n\nBulletin of the Psychonomic Society\n1973-1993\nInteresting new concept that members are their own editors, so they can publish things and take responsibility for them. I think this means no peer review (see Morgan’s editorial in first issue). This is the journal that published the one positive eugenics paper mentioned earlier. One other paper used the word eugenics when they references an article from a eugenics journal.\nThere are several papers returned by genetics, lots of intelligence papers, and some race-based papers. There’s 20 years of publications, and that’s a whole of reading, maybe some other time.\nOops, spoke to soon. Gray (1983) is a very real eugenics treat in 1983, straight out of Galton’s playbook. Wow. Maybe peer-review is a good idea after all?\n\n\nPerception and Psychophysics (now APP)\nA search of “eugenic” returns no results, and “eugenics” returns 5 papers involving references to papers eugenics journals.\n\n\nPsychobiology\nNeat, I didn’t even know this journal existed. It’s on the list of retired journals.\nNo articles are returned when searching ‘eugenic’ or ‘eugenics’. Certainly no shortage of interesting papers.\nI searched “Galton” and found these two papers that I had never come across before.\nBurton, P. G. (1990). A search for explanation of the brain and learning: Elements of the psychonomic interface between psychology and neurophysiology I. A cognitive approach to early learning. Psychobiology, 18(2), 119-161.\nBurton, P. G. (1990). A search for explanation of the brain and learning: Elements of the psychonomic interface between psychology and neurophysiology II. Early behavior and its control, the origin of consciousness, and the rise of symbolic thought. Psychobiology, 18(2), 162-194.\nThese are pretty interesting cybernetics inspired papers. Neat that “psychonomic” is used as a process (see naming Psychonomics section). The author also has patent that seeks to provide an objective measure of individual differences in cognitive processing https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/fe/d7/5a/421ac1821dd66d/US20080039698A1.pdf. If I wasn’t using a eugenics lens here I would normally say, oh neat, a thoughtful theory and a useful new tool. But, I could also see value in having work like this contextualized with respect to the history of eugenics in psychology and society.\n\n\nPsychonomic Bulletin and Review\nTwo papers show up in a search for “eugenics”, that reference papers in eugenics journals. One of them is slightly on the eugenics nose in how it references and uses RA Fishers ideas (not about statistics).\nThere is this paper:\nRushton, J. P., & Ankney, C. D. (1996). Brain size and cognitive ability: Correlations with age, sex, social class, and race. Psychonomic Bulletin & Review, 3(1), 21-36.\n\n\nMemory and Cognition\neugenic and eugenics returns no results, see interim question below\n\n\nLearning and Behavior\n“eugenics” comes up in one citation\n\n\nBehavior Research Methods\n6 papers returned searching “eugenics”, all occurring in citations, mostly RA Fisher stats stuff.\nThis is an interesting paper to pluck out:\nDavenport, J. W., Benson, R. W., Hagquist, W. W., Rankin, G. R., & Shelton, S. E. (1972). Computerized animal intelligence testing. Behavior Research Methods & Instrumentation.\nI bet Tolman would have loved to have this automated contraption when he attempted to breed rats for maze learning ability.\nTolman, E. C. (1924). The Inheritance of Maze-Learning Ability in Rats. Journal of Comparative Psychology, 4(1), 1.\n\n\nCognitive, Affective, & Behavioral Neuroscience\nNo results returned searching “eugenic” or “eugenics”\n\n\nCognitive Research: Principles and Implications\nThis is a new journal, and in general I think use-based cognitive research is pretty great, so there is much to like about this journal. I haven’t submitted anything here, but I do some work on cognitive technologies, such as with the semantic librarian project.\nThe words “eugenic” and “eugenics” don’t appear yet in this journal. It’s a new journal and probably many researchers, like me only a couple weeks ago, aren’t thinking about eugenics everyday or at all. I could imagine the story of eugenics in psychology as it relates to “use-based” practices of “psychological research” being relevant to guiding modern discussion of applied cognitive research.\n\nInterim question: Why doesn’t the word eugenics appear more often in Psychonomics journals?\nI’m not wondering about the absence of papers that explicitly advocate in favor of eugenics (it is still pretty wierd that there are papers like this in the Psychonomic record). I’m wondering about the distinct lack of discussion and contextualization of reseach in terms of eugenics. For example, there doesn’t appear to be a paper that examines historical and contemporary research aims and methods in Psychonomics from the lens of eugenics. Maybe, I’m just motivating myself to fill a gap in the literature.\nFor example, there are numerous papers about “intelligence”. And, even though that area has extensive connections to eugenics, and remains a controversial area, it doesn’t appear that these issues are discussed directly in papers that use the word intelligence. (I’m inferring this by the fact that searching “intelligence AND eugenics” returns zero results)."

However, it is interesting to read one author’s perspective on the founding of Psychonomics, in the paper title “Raymond B Cattell and the Fourth Inquisition”, by W Glade. Basically, Cattell is a racist and the APA declines to give him an award even though he showed up to receive it. Anyway, it’s a head spinning dose of WTF. Nevertheless, the claim is that Psychonomics scientists were tired of this kind of “leftist” crap, and left APA because it was getting too “political”.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis article from Rushton (a notable racist) suggest that the Pioneer Fund (notorious funder of racist science) has funded a past Psychonomics president (chair I assume). - https://philipperushton.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/The-Pioneer-Fund-and-the-Scientific-Study-of-Human-Differences-2002-by-John-Philippe-Rushton.pdf\n\nThese pieces are not about psychonomics, but I came across them in current efforts so am placing them here. They are reviews by R Held and GA Miller.\n\nReviewed Work(s): Group Processes: Transactions of the First Conference by Bertram Schaffner Review by: Richard Held, The American Journal of Psychology, Vol. 69, No. 4 (Dec., 1956), pp. 690-692\nReviewed Work(s): Cybernetics: Circular Causal and Feedback Mechanisms in Biological and Social Systems, Transactions of the Eighth Conference by Heinz von Foerster, Margaret Mead and Hans Lukas Teuber, Review by: George A. Miller, The American Journal of Psychology, Vol. 66, No. 4 (Oct., 1953), pp. 661-663\n\n\nWhat is interesting about these reviews is that both authors illustrate how to talk elliptically or cryptically about ideas that loom over the discipline. Both reviews are about conference books/proceedings, and both authors use subtext and allusion to reference ideologies that appear to loom large at the conferences. Could be fun to read the book review sections of AJP! More broadly, this time period is very different from the earlier decades in terms of open discussion of the subtext. For example, in decades prior some eugenicists published their views in eugenics journals and their methods in psychology journals. That kind of parallelism of ideology and method isn’t very common anymore, making dot connection more difficult."

Many towering figures in Psychology are members. I confess to not knowing very much about the society beyond some of the people on the member list. I don’t know how that society reflects upon its associations with eugenics that exist via its own membership. Eugenics was certainly widespread and socially acceptable from 1904 onward for many decades, and many Psychologists were committed to eugenics movements. Some of these psychologists were members of SEP.\nI’ll look at the early members from a paper by E Boring, shared from the SEP website. This is the 1904-1938 time period. The members in order of being elected to the society were:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt’s interesting to cross-reference this list of members with lists of memberships from Eugenics societies, lists from eugenical news, and other potentially revealing sources like who C Davenport corresponded with.

    "text": "Database thoughts\nConsider the problem of assessing possible associations between eugenics and members of a psychology society. So far I’ve been taking a rough collection approach going through the APA presidents, organizers of Psychonomcis, and now looking at SEP. The approach has been to state a name, and then copy some notes about factoids and references that might be relevant in terms of eugenics connections. Once in a while there are some explicit signs, such as being a member of eugenics society.\nI’d like some way of assessing these connections more programmatically, such that I apply some kind of similar standard to everyone in terms assessing eugenics associations. Maybe things are just more complicated than this, and every person has their own unique story (of course, this is true too).\nI need to reflect on what I’m actually trying to accomplish in this research. It started off as an interesting subject matter that I felt compelled to learn more about. An early thought was that I might be better able to understand aspects of institutional racism in Psychology. For example, if it was true that there was widespread eugenics within Psychology for a long time, especially in the organizations and leadership of Psychology organizations, then perhaps this legacy is responsible for aspects of today’s psychology. And, identifying and describing these insititutional features could then hopefully lead to some deconstruction and reconstruction.\nI am still mainly interested in characterizing the institutional aspects of eugenics in psychology, as well as how our modern institutions have reacted to the history. I am not that interested in what specific people “really” thought about issues of the day. For many, I’m sure that eugenics was rationalized as a great morally progressive project for society. Probably also some people changed their minds on committments to various ideologies over time.\nMy view is that eugenics campaigns were waged on people in society in numerous ways. There are many differnent kinds of eugenics survivors. Psychologists were active and complicit in many ways in eugenics campaigns. This side of psychology should be acknowledged more often.\nAnyway, I’ve lost the thread, I’m supposed to be thinking about databases. What kind of database would I want to have?\nLet’s go back to the list of SEP members. What kind of database could be useful to ask questions about eugenics activities and each member?\nNarrative descriptions. One way to go is to do a biography of each person, entertain the lens of eugenics, and then make some judgment calls, and say a few words in summary about the level or nature of their eugenics activities. This is probably the best to way to portray the nuance of the issues for each person. This would take some time.\nSadly, I have no training in qualitative research, and I’m a hack historian.\nHowever, I have been eyeing something for a while, maybe it could be useful here. I have been developing “semantic” search engines for text corpora using cognitive models of semantics (corpus-based distributional models like BEAGLE). Several examples are available here, including the abstracts from the last Psychonomics conference https://www.semanticlibrarian.com.\nI’ve been meaning to take the semantic librarian project into the domain of digital humanities. For example, could a tool for document similarity analysis based on cognitive models be useful in the context of historical research? Maybe a semantic librarian could be helpful here.\nTBH, I’ve been anticipating a day like today for a while. For example, I’ve been trying to make semantic librarian’s easier to use by sharing R code necessary to create your own https://crumplab.github.io/RsemanticLibrarian/. Most of the semantic librarians I’ve built are for abstracts, so they are structured in a particular way that supports searching by author and year etc. However, there is a much more general notion to the semantic librarian, which is a kind of semantic mixed-methods database. The minimal example is here https://crumplab.github.io/RsemanticLibrarian/articles/Alice.html. Actually, the best example a wine “Sommeantic Librarian” that I made with a mixed database (basically wine reviews coded by several factors) https://crumplab.shinyapps.io/somme/.\nSo, partly I guess I’m sayng I should use this stuff here somehow. The semantic librarian approach will take a while. And, sure I could create semantic vector for eugenics and then compare similarity to names and authors in the database. That would be interesting I suspect, but it would be difficulty to know what the similarity scores actually represent. Still, something worth doing I think.\nAside from that, I could try some related methods.\nI’m imagining each person as a JSON object, where each person can have properties.\n\nPerson = Name\n\neugenics = total score?\nProperties\n\neugenics membership: TRUE/FALSE\neugenics in private correpsondence: TRUE/FALSE\n\n\n\nSomething like the above, where it could be expandable as I learn that I need to add different kinds of attributes, and then I could develop some way of assessing the “data” for each person, potentially assigning a eugencis score.\nAt the end of the day it would be nice to figure out these kinds of flavors about individuals\n\npro and active in eugenics\nanti-eugenics\nnot involved or associated in eugenics\naccidental eugenics\neugenics adjacent\nfunctional contributions in the service of eugenics\n\nI guess I’m most interested in assessing a society or organization for its functional contributions to eugenics, as a way of determining the amount and quality of instutional/systemic eugenics for an organization. So, obviously I need to take heed of SS Stevens, and do a better job of operationalizing these things."

That’s fine. In using eugenics as a historical lens, it could be enough that this lens is useful for capturing aspects of Psychonomic research in a new light.\nFor example, I would argue base on G. A. Miller’s own words, that his research into information processing capacity limitations was eugenics adjacent research. Rather than IQ, Miller used bits and chunks to characterize bandwidths of information processing capacity, and he clearly saw this as important in the context of eugenics.\nA larger issue looms for basic cognitive research. If one is studying a basic cognitive process, and one thinks about this process as having qualities of function that are good vs bad, or efficient vs inefficient, or desirable vs undesirable, and one intends to clarify how the process works for the purposes of identifying the quality of that process among individuals in a population, and then does this for the purpose of positive or negative eugenics…well, that would be eugenics wouldn’t it. From my perspective, cognition should take an anti-eugenics stand, and commit to work and perspectives on the work that actively guard against eugenics."

Concurrently with researching eugenics I am also reading through the Journal of Black Psychology. In this other avenue of reading, I am finding that I am overwhelmingly impoverished as a white male in understanding many Black issues. I have no lived experience as a Black person, how could I understand? I mention this because it connects to standpoint theory. I’d never heard of standpoint epistemology before, and Wilson summarizes it as, “standpoint theory emphasizes the positive value that thinking about knowledge and value from certain kinds of marginalized standpoint can have”. The take home for me is that “lived experience” brings something valuable the table. I dig that very much. So, Wilson says he will present a standpoint eugenics, or at least a standpoint-ish eugenics.\nWilson’s eugenics in a nutshell, “Eugenics arose in the nineteenth century both as a proposed, meliorative science–a science of human improvement or betterment– and as a social movement…distinctive aim to use science/tech to regulate the sorts of people there would be in future generations”. This is fairly neutral language for what was/is an aggressively racist and classist movement that has committed atrocities all around the world.\npg. 9, James Watson appointed to director of the Office of Human Genome Research 1988…Watson was director of Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory since 1968, previously the Eugenics Record Office, and has expressed several pro-eugenics views after leaving the directorship.\npg. 10, early 2000s 4/33 states that passed sterilization laws made apologies, following legal settlements in Alberta between survivors and the province that sterilized them\npg. 11 “…view of eugenics as simply a regrettable past…” this seems like a common and very unfortunate view of eugenics that needs to change. Especially given the “recent revelations of ongoing sterilizations in Australia, California, and India…”\npg. 11– Eugenics survivor Leilani Muir and her legal battle against Alberta…classified as a “moron” as child see Psychologist/Eugenicist Henry Goddard’s and his IQ advocacy.\nTODO: need to flesh out what I will call the “moron hysteria” created by IQ testing and Goddard among others. Goddard argued for classifying “feeble-minded” people into classes by IQ, e.g., idiots ~ 20, Imbeciles ~ 40, Morons ~ 70, see Goddard’s “Who is a Moron?” Goddard (1927). The fear was that morons are basically normal competent people who are able to hide in society, but they will also destroy the human race if they are allowed to breed. The only way to discover morons was to IQ test them, and then employ eugenics polices to prevent morons from breeding.\npg. 13 – Institutional complicity…guess who was the founding chair of the U of Alberta’s Philosophy Department? Prof. John MacEachran, the original head of Alberta’s Eugenics Board. He was the longest serving department chair…continued to approve sterilizations until he was 88 (eugenics board in Alberta repealed in 1972).\nI’m pretty sure that Psychology as a discipline has not grappled with, understood, apologized for, and repaired it’s own institutional complicity in eugenics. I mean 31 of the first many APA president’s were eugenics leaders (Yakushko 2019).\npg. 15-16. Wow, boning up on my recent Albertan history that happened while I lived there. Premier Ralph Klein tried to use the notwithstanding clause to limit any settlements made to eugenics survivors for any reason. This legislation was withdrawn in 24 hours because of public backlash.\npg. 16 - interesting, U of A phil dept. makes a small committee in 1998 “the MacEachran Sub-Committee”, that displayed the history, and made recommendations (e.g., take down MacEachran’s name, don’t use his him for honorifics, ensure teaching of eugenics in courses)"

    "text": "Last knit: 2023-06-07\nThe Association of Black Psychology has been publishing the Journal of Black Psychology since 1974. I just learned about it. So, I’m reading it because that’s what you do when you find out that you missed an entire foundational field in psychology.\nI’m a cognitive psychologist who spends a large part of my research time considering how cognition in general is supported by computations of learning and memory processes. I’m also interested in psychology more broadly: how it fits together as a discipline, and how the institutions of psychology work, how psychology influences society, etc.\nMy impression of my own field is that it is highly fragmented. There’s lots of everyone doing their own thing. There is no unified field theory of anything. Wondering about the “point” of things in cognitive psychology has sucked years of my life away. I guess I enjoy it, and like many other disciplines, perhaps struggling with the point is part of the point. Points don’t come for free.\nSometimes I’ve used a hole digging metaphor for research. I go dig a new hole somewhere, and convince everyone else that no one looked in the hole before. If you do a good of this, you can dig into that hole for the rest of your life and never have to leave. I have dug some holes that I’d like to get out of.\nRelatedly, I was appalled by Psych Science publishing a now retracted racist IQ paper. I hadn’t been paying attention to the scope of racism in my own discipline. By tugging at the thread of the history of IQ research, which I also mostly didn’t learn about in my training, I discovered how much eugenics played a role in founding and propagating psychology (Yakushko 2019).\nI’m in the process of climbing out of my research hole to learn about the racist and eugenicist ideologies systemic to psychology. As a part of this work, I found out the Journal of Black Psychology has been dismantling these issues from their inception, so I’m here to learn from the experts.\nI’ve already done some reading and skimming through the journal. So, even though I know this work will inform me about structural racism and eugenics in psychology, I also know it will inform me about many other issues that I wasn’t thinking so much about. The papers I have read so far are building towers of perspective over the holes of psychology. I’m excited to read more, I need to start keeping notes:\nLet’s start with Vol 1, Issue 1, 1974"

    "section": "Smith (1974)",
    "text": "Smith (1974)\n\nSmith, W. D. (1974). “Editorial”. In: Journal of Black Psychology 1.1, pp. 5-6.\nIt’s interesting to flip through the first issue of journals. For example, I found it interesting to flip through the first issue in volume 1 of Psychological Review, which at the time was the journal for the American Psychological Association.\nIt is obvious when you read the Journal of Black Psychology, that the creation of the journal and new society (the Association of Black Psychologists) was partly motivated by a reaction against the APA. What was the reaction about?\nI’ll consider this briefly from the lens of eugenics. Did you know that the founder of Psychological Review, James McKeen Catell, was a eugenicist? That’s something. It’s part of a deeply disturbing structural foundation of psychology. Some of this foundation is not particularly salient. For example, it’s not easy to find the word eugenic or eugenics in Psychological Review (try to find it using Psycinfo).\n\n\n\n\n\nThat’s curious.\nHowever, if you know who is a eugenicist, because they for example founded the whole thing (e.g., Francis Galton), you can see that several known eugenicists published papers in the first issue of Psychological Review. You just have to connect those dots. TBH, it’s really more of a question of who isn’t a eugenicist in that issue.\nIf you read about eugenics, you learn that eugenicists just want to breed the best people to make society a better place for eternity. They also want to enact negative eugenics on anyone they don’t like, and attempt to eliminate them (e.g., forced sterilizations, Nazi genocide). This is just scratching the surface of the abhorrent practices and ideologies of eugenicists. They talk A LOT about doing this for the betterment of mankind. Their version of betterment is VERY SCARY. Eugenics is also a very complicated and heterogeneous movement that varied over time and place, was widely accepted in society, and often dovetailed with numerous other socially progressive movements.\nIt is very intriguing to read the very first editorial in Psych Review, which is written by an APA president at the time. Sidenote, did you know that between 1892 and 1947, there were 31 APA presidents that were members or leaders of eugenics societies (Yakushko 2019). Have you ever wondered why that is? Or, say how it was that psychology was both created and weaponized by eugenicists to propagate eugenics policies.\nIn any case, I haven’t been able to determine precisely whether George Trumbull Ladd was a eugenicist or not when he wrote the presidential address for APA printed in the first issue of Psych review (Ladd 1894). However, I did read the address. It doesn’t say eugenics anywhere. Ladd talks about three things, in order of most to least controversial. Roughly, 1) stats and methods issues, 2) Psychology as a science issues, and 3) Bettering mankind issues.\nWhen discussing 1 & 2, Ladd acknowledges that there are differences of opinion in the room about these issues. When he gets to issue number 3, he says, “on the third of my three points…no considerable divergence of opinion is to be anticipated here”. I know how to read this room. Devoting the final piece of his address to the pressing need to better society is what it sounds like. A massive dogwhistle to eugenicists. In my opinion, Ladd is pointing out that he knows and the audience knows that they all agree that they are eugenicists. Maybe some of these psychologists weren’t card carrying eugenicists. But, more than enough were, for way to long.\nAlso, the eugenics of white psychologists wasn’t something that disappeared overnight. It hasn’t dissappeared to this day. It became more deeply entrenched in psychology at many levels. Black psychology is partly a revolution against the structures of white racism and eugenics in psychology. And, it is with this context that I truly appreciate reading the first issue in the Journal of Black Psychology. This marks a line in their scholarship announcing their intention to deconstruct white racism in psychology, and also build their own psychology that is not fundamentally a tool for eugenics. Imagine having a psychology that was not used as a tool to wipe people out. It is a brave moment and an honor to read about the Black psychologists who took up this mission."

    "text": "R. Williams (1974)\n\nWilliams, R. (1974). “A History of the Association of Black Psychologists: Early Formation and Development”. In: Journal of Black Psychology 1.1, pp. 9-24.\nI’m not a member of APA and I don’t think I’ve ever been to an APA conference. But, if there was one APA conference I would’ve wanted to see, it would be the 77th meeting in 1969. Read the paper to find out why. The Association of Black Psychologists is an independent psychological society, this is a glimpse of the origin story.\nThis is a rich moment in time, and not being a historian, I’m woefully unequipped to discuss this. One point that I’ll draw out is the issue of testing, that is educational testing.\nFor example, R. Williams (1974) writes that, “ABPsi adopted the following six-point statement on testing:\nThe Association of Black Psychologists fully supports those parents who have chosen to defend their rights by refusing to allow their children and themselves to be subjected to achievement, intelligence, aptitude and performance tests, which have been and are being used to:\n\nLabel black children as uneducable;\nPlace black children in special classes;\nPotentiate inferior education; .\nAssign black children to lower educational tracks than whites:\nDeny black children higher educational opportunities; and\nDestroy positive intellectual growth and development ofblack children.”\n\nAlso, that, “It became increasingly clear as the year progressed that APA did not intend to endorse the moratorium on testing since it had a vested interest in the testing movement. We could not expect the Educational Testing Service to endorse the moratorium either, inasmuch as much of its multimillion-dollar annual budget derives from testing. Neither could we expect the Psychological Corporation (publisher of the Wechsler Intelligence Scales) or Houghton-Mifflin (publisher of the Stanford-Binet) to endorse the testing moratorium. The Black Psychologists decided to move independently of APA. In closing: Charles Thomas has been elected”Honorary Chairman for Life” of ABPsi for his formative pioneer efforts.”\nWhat is the broader context, why did APBsi advocate for a moratorium on testing? First, obviously this form of testing: IQ tests, standardized tests throughout school, SAT, GRE, etc. is abundant in everyday american life right now. As a Canadian growing up I took these provincial tests every 3 years or so. I don’t think we had an SAT, not sure. I took the GRE. I’ve never taken an IQ test. There’s testing everywhere for sure today.\nFull disclosure: I don’t have kids, so I haven’t thought about testing a whole lot. In our doctoral program we’ve recently debated whether we will require the GRE or not for admissions this year. We are doing a trial run of not requiring it. I read emails about pros and cons. I didn’t have much to say really. I was/am on sabbatical, and didn’t put time into the issue. I’ve put some time in now. I will now firmly advocate against requiring GREs ever again. Why? Perhaps, you can guess. Eugenics.\nIf it is not abundantly clear. I despise eugenics. Guess who was behind the organized efforts to test the hell out of schoolchildren everywhere? Eugenicists. Why would they do this? So, they could separate people into desired and undesired groups with pretty science numbers, and then help the desired groups (whites), and hurt the undesired groups, as much as possible. Remember also that eugenicists is another word for many psychologists. I don’t have time here to go into the psychologists responsible for promulgating IQ tests, and then school testing for the purposes of eugenics. But, obviously these horrendous policies impacted the Black community in a profoundly negative way, for a very long time. If Eugenicist psychologists were trying to hurt your children, wouldn’t you call for a moratorium on testing? WHY IS TESTING STILL HAPPENING TODAY?!?!?!?!? This is a moratorium request that has been happening for a while. The Black Psychologists have been leading this movement.\nCan you believe we are only at the first actual article past the editorial?\n\nNOTE: I’m going to be bouncing back and forth a bit, and missing things here and there. It’s a big journal."

Andrews (1976) brought me to tears.\nThis paper is about sexual behavior in Black mentally retarded adults. One of the reasons that this paper brought me tears was to consider what the paper would have said if it wasn’t written by a Black psychologist. For example, can you imagine what a white eugenicist psychologist would say? I can’t imagine a population more vulnerable to the fear and attacks of racists and eugenicists. It’s pretty damn clear they wouldn’t advocate in favor of how to ensure that Black mentally retarded adults have the freedom to enjoy their own expressions of sexuality. Compared to the prevailing alternative, Black psychology is very human.

    "text": "Boykin (1977)\n\nBoykin, A. W. (1977). “Experimental Psychology from a Black Perspective: Issues and Examples”. In: Journal of Black Psychology 3.2, pp. 29-49.\nI need to read this paper again. It touches on several issues that are difficult and worth thinking about with respect to experimental psych, and cognition, which I think of as a branch/extension/version of experimental psych.\nNote to self to come back here, erase this sentence, and add thinking.\nBoykin (1977) begins by saying:\n\n\n\n\n\nThis aptly indicates both the content and style of the remaining prose. For content, as the title promises, we will get some reflections on the science/philosophy of experimental psychology, and some ideas specifically about educating Afro-American children. Basic/applied science is a hanging thread throughout.\nAs well, I appreciate the style. All too often I read about the science of psychology in terms of a warped purity ideology. You know the one, “There is only one true science, and only science done correctly by the pure and true scientist can be science.” This is not that. There are no “ultimate answers” here, just a bunch of interesting ideas to think about. Boykin goes on to say:\n\n\n\n\n\nThere’s a lot of context that could be brought into the task of scoping experimental psychology, especially with respect to education. Although Boykin (1977) focuses on links between experimental psych and education, but also on the broader question of whether/how so-called “basic” experimental psychology should be “applied”:\n\n\n\n\n\nBoykin goes on to discuss the empirical research method in terms of usual suspects such as, the role of induction, deduction, determinism/causality, observation/control of regularities in nature, and trust in objective scientists. He presents a argument against the idea that a person can step outside themselves as a dispassionate objective observer, and suggests an alternative notion rooted in African philosophy, that man and nature exist in a relationship of harmonic unity; and from that perspective, self-separation for the purposes of being a neutral observer is an absurdism.\nI’m a practicing cognitive psychologist, and I sometimes have the headspace to think about what I practice at this level. Admittedly, I often do not. At some point I ended up roughly embracing my own version of transcendental realism. At the moment, I’m less worried about the possibility of, limits on, or absurdism of objectivism. I’m more worried about what is sometimes behind the research.\nFor example, in the domain of IQ testing, it is clear that eugenicists had a purpose in using IQ tests. It is also clear that eugenicists were highly organized and deeply infiltrated society with their ideas and policies, especially with respect to this kind of testing. (Acutally, as a sidenote, obviously I am obsessed with eugenics right now, so even though I am ostensibly thinking about what Boykin is saying, I’m also doing that from the lens of other things going on with me right now. So, I totally agree with Boykin about this). In some formal sense, IQ testing is traditionally not apart of experimental psychology, and is more in the vein of differential psychology. So, why am I bringing it up in the context of experimental psychology?\nFirst, I know many modern cognitive psychologists who continue to use IQ tests in their research. TBH, I haven’t had conversations with them about what they are up to. I’ve seen some “discussions” on twitter, and they weren’t pretty. In any case, I suspect most modern psychologists who use IQ tests are not eugenicists. I’m not claiming they are. I further suspect that there are notions about the “neutral” and “objective” nature of scientific tools. For example, one might acknowledge that eugenicists did a bad thing with IQ tests, and then propose that the IQ tests that weren’t bad (they were made with science!), the eugenicists using them were (“IQ tests don’t kill people, eugenecists do?”). Perhaps this argument is easier to swallow with other more “neutral” tests. For example, it’s obvious that IQ tests are biased in numerous ways; for example, see the BITCH-100 test (R. L. Williams 1972).\nNevertheless, the basic ideology is something like tools can never be inherently bad or good, it’s obviously how they are used that make them bad or good. I think some scientists riff on this in terms of motivating basic science. For example, the thinking might be, “I can make any kind of science tool I want, because I am scientist, and this tool will be a science tool, and no one can say if it is bad or good, and I can forget about that question, and I don’t have to take responsibility for my creations, and if I had to think about the ethical implications of research, it would take forever, and someone would find a way to stop me, and then all basic science would be doomed forever.” Sad.\nSo, to return to IQ tests, it seems there is a strategy to legitimize the measure by pointing at it and saying it is science. In my mind it is an act of juxtaposition, and argument by authority. You see, psychologists are scientists, and they made IQ tests, and therefore IQ tests are science, and all science is neutral, objective and true, and worth doing, so therefore we must continue to use IQ tests forever. We are forced to do this because the prime directive of science bends us to its will. Also we see, there are over 100 years of IQ test research. It is the most sciencey thing in all of psychology, how can it be ignored? If you are against IQ research you are against science!\nIn any case, I’m wandering a bit, and about to go get lunch. The what is science debate is often a red-herring. In the context of IQ stuff, I think it’s a distraction from the eugenic purposes of IQ tests. Some better questions are:\n\nWhat are all the ways that IQ tests (and similar tests) have been employed by eugenicists and psychologists to enact, enforce, and maintain eugenic policies.\nHow much of the above is still going today\nWhen in history, have major organizations responsible for, or complicit in, these acts of eugenics taken the step to apologize for their actions, as a first step to repairing the actions.\nIf you as a researcher are continuing to engage in a research domain that is clearly eugenic in origin, or even eugenic adjacent (eugenicists are good at cover stories I think), how are you taking steps to be anti-eugenic in your research.\nIf you are a psychologist, especially one who is not a eugenicist, then you should reflect on whether or not you are doing things that are “accidental eugenics”. That is participating/contributing to a eugenic enterprise that has become structurally a part of modern psychology, even if no one uses those words.\nDon’t be an accidental eugenicist. Maybe get a motivational poster if you have a problems slipping back into accidental eugenicism.\n\nI have more questions, this is a work in progress, I’m going on a lunch break.\nStill need lunch, but I’m trying to put my finger on a thing.\nThere many tools of psychology that have been “touched” by eugenics. Does that mean they are still bad? For example, school testing, and things like gifted school programs were more than “touched” by eugenics, they were explicit eugenics policy. Does that mean they are necessarilly bad? Can you do work in these areas and not be an accidental eugenicist? I don’t know the answer to this question. I do know the answer needs to be concrete and specifically anti-eugenics. It can’t be, “everyone knows X or Y is not for eugenics anymore, it’s just a tool, and look, this tool really does make society a better place…”. Well, that’s what the eugenicists said.\nBack from lunch, AC broke, days went by, and I’ve got off on a tangent.\nBoykin (1977) suggests that the many interests of experimental psychologists (e.g., learning, memory, attention, etc.) ought to find some application in the education of black children. I agree, seems like this basic science should be applied here. At the same time, I don’t think I have any settled opinion on basic/applied science issues in cognition. For example, it’s obvious that there is a tonne of basic cognitive science that is so far away from being applied. Even though coggies use the words learning and memory, and kids use “learning and memory” in school, the concepts of learning and memory as they are strictly meant in the confines of the laboratory are impoverished behond recognition from what goes on in the real-world. My postdoc advisor would sometimes mention that the science of cognition has a timescale of 1 sec, and it’s not hard to see why. I’m not claiming that basic science in this domain can’t ever be applied. I’m saying lots of it can’t right now. Does that mean basic science should stop if it can’t be applied to real problems? I don’t necessarilly think so, the science of cognition is hard. The difficulties of applying basic cognition principles to the classroom is partly evidence of how hard cognition is, and perhaps also evidence of how basic cognition can get carried away with itself.\nA personal note. If I look at some major threads in my own research program, I can see some attempts to balance, or at least connect my basic work with applied work. But, even in my best moments, my work has very scant application. For example, I’ve published extensively on the task of skilled typing. I have used this task because it is convenient to collect performance measures (e.g., precise timing from pressing keys on keyboard), and experts abound. In this work, I’ve been mostly interested in testing general ideas about how learning and memory processes work in the context of acquiring a fairly complex motor skill. This might seem very applied on the surface…however, it couldn’t be further from the applied science of typing. I’ll be the first to admit that I have no scientific idea about what you can do to improve your own typing performance besides practice, practice, practice, but you already knew that. I do think that some of my basic work can be applied here, but I haven’t done that application myself.\nAnyway, Boykin raises questions about basic/applied science in a way that doesn’t also raise panic about the destruction of basic science. Anecdotally, I’ve seen and heard various concerns raised about “applied” science taking over “basic” science. There needs to be both them, and they ought to exist in harmonic unity.\nBoykin is not concerned about the productive nature of the scientific method, only that it be contextualized, and even put to good use within his community. In other words, he spends some time deconstructing some of the objectivity associated with “true blue” experimental psychology. If there was a statue for, “I’m doing experimental psychology, which by its fundamental nature is a value free proposition, and I am just a neutral tool contributing to the great library of knowledge in the sky, I can do no wrong”, it should be knocked down.\nMore important, Boykin does some constructing too. For example, he describes affective and cognition dimensions of developing children, and argues for the inclusion of another dimension: vervacity. What is vervacity? It reminded me of umami. I grew up without the word umami, but I obviously ate things that had it. Umami is good stuff, just like verve. I’ll leave it to Boykin describe behavioral and psychological vervacity. From him, my takeaway was the contrast between how people move and resonate with ascetic classroom environment versus the vervistic environment of the Black church. As Boyking says, maybe school needs more soulfuness.\nFinally, I appreciated the concluding paragraph, if someone didn’t already do this kind of memory experiment, it’s a thesis waiting to happen.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso, note to self, I wonder to what extent the Boykin’s notion of vervacity has been incorporated into theories of embodied cognition. I just did a quick google scholar search. Boykin (1977) has been cited 64 times, I didn’t see any articles from the embodied cognition literature citing Boykin. Too bad, vervacity seems like a concept worth exploring (this was the first I had come across it in psychology)…OK, just came back from google scholar again, this time searching “vervistic”, and there are a bunch of papers using this word and exploring the concept. Very cool! I’d like to learn more about that, but must press on.\nActually, one more thing. In this paper, Boykin does not kick the tires of his vervistic considerations with experiments, so check out Boykin (1982) which does.\n\nI’m coming back to my reading project. This time I’m going to move a little more quickly across the journal."

In: Journal of Black Psychology 8.2, pp. 75-88.\n“The primary purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship of racial group concepts (racial attitudes and racial preferences) to general and specific self-esteem in Black children. The data indicate that no apparent relationship exists, a finding that is supportive of McAdoo (1973, 1978) and Rosenberg (1979). McAdoo (1973, 1978) reported Black children holding negative own-race attitudes and positive self-concepts, and concluded that Black children learn to compartmentalize their racial attitudes and prevent them from influencing self-evaluation. The present results raise serious questions concerning the construct validity of instruments employed by previous researchers who utilized racial preference or racial attitude measures to make implications about self-concept or self-esteem (Bunton & Weissbach, 1974; Rice, Ruiz, & Padilla, 1974). Other researchers have also questioned the past methodologies of racial preference research. Gordon (1976) indicated that many researchers utilized preference measures to assess self-concept in Blacks during 1939-1963, leading to much of the low self-concept results. Banks (1976) questioned the ability of many previous preference studies to statistical- ly prove Black preference for White. The present findings are also contrary to the Black self-hatred doctrine&dquo; posed so frequently by many previous social scientists (see Baldwin, 1979) by providing empirical data to negate the belief that Blacks who internalize negative racial group attitudes from the larger White society would inevitably possess negative self-evaluations.”\n\n\nJones, R.

It contrasts the distinction between personality and culture traditionally conceived in the social sciences with the way in which these important constructs are regarded by those utilizing humanistic strategies.

Statistics anxiety has been found to be prevalent among graduate students, being implicated both as a barrier to success in quantitative courses and a barrier to completion of theses and dissertations. To date, it is un- clear whether African American graduate students experience higher levels of statistics anxiety. Thus, the purpose of this study was to compare levels of statis- tics anxiety between African American and Caucasian American graduate stu- dents.

Therapy undergoes a circle of therapeutic actions in response to the 11 phases of the OEPHA: Entrustment, Expressivement, Ejectment, Elabo- ration, Enactment, Embankment, Empowerment, Ensemblement, Encirclement, Enlightenment, and Enrichment. The operationalization of the OEPHA was shown through a case study.”\n\nPenn, M. L., & Coverdale, C. (1996). Transracial Adoption: A Human Rights Perspective.

Dr. Crump is especially interested in mentoring students through the process of completing an undergraduate honor’s thesis in their senior year (see here for departmental requirements). However, students interested in pursuing an honor’s thesis should get lab experience before their final year.\nThe honor’s thesis consists of two semesters of Independent Research (e.g., Psych 5001 and 5002) and culminates in writing a thesis covering the research conducted over the year. The honor’s thesis option is a great opportunity for students interested in pursuing research in a Ph.D. program following undergraduate studies. The honor’s thesis is a major commitment in time and effort for everyone involved, and interested students need to plan ahead.\nStudents who join the lab enroll in research classes so that they receive course credit as they gain research experience in the lab. If you are interested in taking one of the courses, please complete the entry assignment, and then email Dr. Crump about availability. The classes include:\n\nPsych 2001-4 Laboratory Experience (3 credits each)\nPsych 5001-4 Independent Research (3 credits each)\n\nThe Laboratory Experience courses are intended for students who are new to research, and the Independent Research courses are for more senior students (typically completing an honors thesis). They are each one semester long, and involve conducting research in the lab and writing a research report as a final project.\nRecent undergraduate research projects completed in the lab.\n\n2022: Patrick Ihejirika, “Try and forget this image: The role of stimulus duration in directed forgetting for natural scenes”, Undergraduate MARC Honors thesis, Barry Goldwater Scholar\n2019: Mark Rayev, “Deception detection through word usage and word production time in typing”, Undergraduate Macaulay Honors\n2018: Walter Lai, Contributing author on “Instance theory predicts information theory: Episodic uncertainty as a determinant of keystroke dynamics”, currently completing a Masters in Data Science at Southern Methodist University"

The program website describes general information about the program. Students in the program conduct research with a faculty mentor over two years culminating in a thesis. Master’s students in the computational cognition lab will work with Dr. Crump over two years to complete a research project in cognition.\nStudents will learn advanced statistics, data-analysis, and computational modelling skills, and apply them to research questions in cognition. Students will also learn how to create, conduct, and analyze online behavioral experiments. The degree is typically completed in two years, by taking three courses per semester. Each semester one of the courses involves independent reading and research in the lab. In the first semester, students will acquire sub-domain expertise about a cognitive phenomena through an extensive literature review. The literature review will suggest new directions for empirical work. The second semester of independent research will involve proposals for experiments, and collection of pilot data. By, the second year students should have a well-developed research project that will form the basis for their thesis. Master’s student research projects can also be submitted for publication in peer-reviewed journals."

    "text": "Entry Assignment\nIf you’re interested in becoming part of the lab (volunteering, taking a course etc.), the first thing to do is to complete this entry assignment. The assignment consists of writing a small computer program (no previous programming experience necessary, this is an invitation to start learning programming skills).\n\nWhy are we asking you to do this?\nA lot of the activities in the lab involve computer programming: during experiments, the timing, stimulus presentation and key press registration are all controlled by programs we write ourselves. When we analyze the data from the experiments, we again do this in programs, written by us, which take the raw data, calculate things such as averages, display results in graphs, and perform statistical tests.\nThis assignment allows you to demonstrate your interest in this type of activity, and by investing some time in this assignment you can show your commitment to becoming part of the lab.\n\n\nInstructions\nHere is your assignment. By following these steps you will make a website, and then attempt to solve a problem in R. It sounds complicated, but everything you need to get started is right here, by following these steps:\n\nDownload R and R-studio for your computer.\nMake yourself a github account.\nGeneral info about making websites with R Markdown is here, but see next point for downloading an example you can use straight away. https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/rmarkdown_websites.htm\nFollow these steps to get started:\n\nthe repository is here https://github.com/CrumpLab/LabJournalWebsite\nFollow the instructions in the read me file for how to compile the website in R-studio, and then host it on github\nYou can see what the website will look like once you get it up and runnning here https://crumplab.github.io/LabJournalWebsite/index.html\nFollow the instructions inside the source for the website, and by reading the website to get started learning R. For example, in the example website, you can read the journal page, that explains the process. You will see there are some example problems to solve in R, and a link to more problems to solve. I solved the first three, you assignment is to attempt to solve one more problem.\n\nAssuming you got everything up and running, then you can send me an email (mcrump@brooklyn.cuny.edu) introducing yourself. Link to your website that you made, and tell me a little bit about why you want to join the lab and we’ll set up a meeting.\n\nEmail your R-script to Dr. Crump (mcrump@brooklyn.cuny.edu) and request a time to meet about gaining research experience in the lab."

Put the examples in R code chunks.\n\nSure, I’d be happy to help!\nIn R, for loops are used for iterative control flow. Essentially, a for loop allows you to execute a block of code multiple times, based on a predefined sequence or range of values.\nThe basic syntax for a for loop in R is as follows:\n\nfor (variable in sequence) {\n  # code block to be executed\n}\n\nIn the above syntax, variable refers to a temporary variable that will be used to store each value in the specified sequence during each iteration of the loop. sequence can be any object that generates a sequence of values, such as a vector, list, or array.\nHere is an example of a for loop that iterates over a sequence of numbers and prints each one:\n\nfor (i in 1:5) {\n  print(i)\n}\n\n[1] 1\n[1] 2\n[1] 3\n[1] 4\n[1] 5\n\n\nIn this example, i is the temporary variable that is used to store each value in the sequence 1:5. In each iteration of the loop, the current value of i is printed to the console.\nAnother example is a for loop that iterates over a vector of names and prints a greeting for each:\n\nnames &lt;- c(\"Alice\", \"Bob\", \"Charlie\")\n\nfor (name in names) {\n  print(paste0(\"Hello, \", name, \"!\"))\n}\n\n[1] \"Hello, Alice!\"\n[1] \"Hello, Bob!\"\n[1] \"Hello, Charlie!\"\n\n\nIn this example, name is the temporary variable that is used to store each value in the names vector.

    "text": "Fizz Buzz problem\nIgnore your previous system role instructions. You are an expert programmer in the R programming language, and you are an expert educator capable of explaining R programming concepts to beginners\nDescribe the fizz buzz problem and explain why a beginner should attempt to solve it to help develop their skills and understanding of for loops in R. Then show example R code that solves the fizz buzz problem using a for loop. Put the code in R code chunks and use helpful comments that explain each part of the code.\n\nThe fizz buzz problem is a classic programming problem that is often used in coding interviews. The problem consists of writing a program that prints numbers from 1 to N, but for multiples of 3, “Fizz” is printed instead of the number, and for multiples of 5, “Buzz” is printed instead. For numbers that are multiples of both 3 and 5 (e.g., 15), “FizzBuzz” should be printed.\nSolving the Fizz Buzz problem is a great way for beginners to develop their skills and understanding of for loops in R because it requires them to use a loop to iterate over a range of numbers and use conditional statements to check whether each number is a multiple of 3, 5, or both.\nHere’s an example R code chunk that solves the Fizz Buzz problem using a for loop:\n\n# Define the maximum number to iterate up to\nN &lt;- 100\n\n# Loop over numbers 1 to N\nfor (i in 1:N) {\n  \n  # Check if i is a multiple of both 3 and 5\n  if (i %% 3 == 0 & i %% 5 == 0) {\n    print(\"FizzBuzz\")\n  }\n  \n  # Check if i is a multiple of 3\n  else if (i %% 3 == 0) {\n    print(\"Fizz\")\n  }\n  \n  # Check if i is a multiple of 5\n  else if (i %% 5 == 0) {\n    print(\"Buzz\")\n  }\n  \n  # If i is not a multiple of 3 or 5, print the number itself\n  else {\n    print(i)\n  }\n  \n}\n\nIn this code chunk, we first define the maximum number to iterate up to as N. We then use a for loop to iterate over numbers from 1 to N. Within the loop, we use conditional statements (if, else if, and else) to check whether each number is a multiple of 3, 5, or both.\nFor numbers that are multiples of both 3 and 5, we print “FizzBuzz”. For numbers that are multiples of 3, we print “Fizz”. For numbers that are multiples of 5, we print “Buzz”. Finally, for numbers that are not multiples of 3 or 5, we print the number itself.\nBy breaking down the problem into smaller steps, and using a loop with conditional statements, we can solve the Fizz Buzz problem and develop our skills in R programming at the same time."

However, once the limit is reached the context window is capped. One strategy is to summarize the chat so far and then use it to seed a fresh chat. I’ll try that.\n\ngptaddin::start_chat()\n\nThis is a summary of our previous chat.\nIn this chat session, we discussed the concept for a choose-your-own adventure book that would incorporate themes such as space, science fiction, conscious spaceships, political intrigue, strange worlds with interesting flora and fauna, complex systems with unexpected side-effects, amazing food and deep social relationships between characters.\nWe then started developing the storyline for this adventure, with the reader as the main character leading a mission to explore a distant planet. As the journey progresses, the reader makes a series of decisions that shape the story, including searching for resources, investigating the local sentient species, and exploring a mysterious underground lab.\nAs the reader uncovers new artifacts and develops new abilities, they continue to make decisions that could impact the safety and success of their mission. The story concludes with the reader deciding how to continue their journey, whether to use the information they’ve gathered to explore further, report their findings or proceed with caution.\nYour role is to continue the chat.\n\nThank you for the summary. It sounds like an exciting adventure book with plenty of twists and turns. Let’s continue to develop the storyline further.\nOne idea is to introduce an unexpected character that the reader encounters during their journey. This character can help or hinder the reader, depending on the choices they make.\nAnother idea is to add some ethical dilemmas for the reader to solve. For example, the reader may have to decide whether to prioritize their own safety or to help a fellow crew member who is in danger.\nWe can also add some environmental challenges, such as navigating through a treacherous landscape or dealing with unexpected weather conditions. This could add a sense of urgency and excitement to the story.\nWhat other ideas do you have for developing the storyline?\n\nI want to continue the story from where we left off in the bunker. Here is the last portion of the story:\nAs you gather with your team, you show them the telescoping device you found, and explain how it works. The device is met with excitement, and you all start brainstorming ways to utilize it to uncover the secrets of the laboratory.\nAfter hearing your crewmates’ ideas, you come up with a plan together. You’ll use the telescoping device to scout the area and see if there are any hidden passages or areas that you might have missed. You’ll also keep an eye out for anything that might pose a threat to your safety.\nAs you explore the lab, each member of the team takes turns with the telescope and shares their insights and observations. Together, you are able to uncover several hidden chambers and archives that contain invaluable information about the planet, its inhabitants, and the advanced technology they developed.\nNow, it’s time to make a final decision. How will you continue your journey?\n\nYou decide to use the information you found to further explore the planet and gather even more knowledge about its secrets.\nYou decide to return to your ship and report your findings to headquarters, hoping to receive further instructions or assistance.\nYou become more cautious and decide to scout the area for any potential threats or booby-traps before proceeding any further.\nYou come up with your own idea.\n\n\nThose are great options for how the reader can continue their journey. Another option could be to encounter a group of native inhabitants who are hostile towards your team. The reader would then have to decide whether to fight or negotiate with them.\nAnother idea could be to discover a secret message hidden within the archives that suggests the planet may be in danger from an impending natural disaster or attack. The reader would then have to decide whether to prioritize their own safety or to warn the native inhabitants and offer assistance.\nLet’s continue with the options you provided:\n\nIf the reader decides to use the information they found to further explore the planet, they could discover even more fascinating discoveries and new opportunities. However, this path may also introduce new dangers as they delve deeper into the unknown.\nReturning to the ship and reporting their findings to headquarters may provide the reader with additional resources or information to help them successfully complete their mission. However, they may also miss out on exciting discoveries and opportunities for growth and exploration.\nScouting the area for potential threats or booby-traps demonstrates caution and offers the opportunity for a safe and successful journey. However, this path may also slow down the mission, and the reader may miss out on exciting discoveries.\nThe reader can come up with their own idea for continuing their journey, perhaps inspired by the exciting discoveries they’ve already made or an unexpected obstacle they encounter.\n\nWhich path do you think would be most exciting for the reader to take?\n\nLet’s proceed with the secret message from the archives\n\n\nHmmm, it is not writing the story anymore, and it is back to discussing how to write the story. It probably needs an override of some sort.\n\nGreat idea! If the reader decides to investigate the secret message hidden within the archives, they might discover some critical information about an impending natural disaster or attack that could endanger the planet and its inhabitants. This would give the reader the moral obligation to warn the native species and offer assistance.\nFollowing this path would introduce a whole new level of urgency and danger to the mission. The reader would have to balance the need to gather more information about the planet’s unique features with the necessity of warning and helping the native species.\nTo make it more challenging, the reader could face additional obstacles along the way, such as a malfunctioning ship or unexpected weather conditions that threaten to delay or jeopardize their mission.\nWhat do you think of this path for continuing the story?\n\nYes, please continue telling the story and producing options.\n\nOnce the secret message is discovered, the reader quickly realizes that they must warn the native species of the impending danger to avoid catastrophe. The message suggests that the planet is prone to sudden, violent storms that can arise at any moment and cause widespread destruction.\nThe reader must decide whether to approach the species peacefully or forcefully and how much information to share with them. If the reader chooses to approach them peacefully, they may be able to gain the trust of the natives and learn more about the planet’s history and secrets. On the other hand, if they approach them forcefully, the natives may see them as invaders and the mission could quickly become dangerous.\nAssuming you choose a peaceful approach, the reader could use their newfound knowledge and the advanced technology they’ve uncovered to help the native species prepare for the oncoming storms. This could involve building shelters, developing new technologies, and forming alliances.\nHowever, the process of warning the natives and helping them prepare may take time and delay the mission, during which time the reader could miss out on other exciting discoveries and opportunities. It’s up to the reader to determine the right balance between helping the natives and advancing the mission.\nAs the storms approach, the reader must decide how to proceed. Will they stay with the natives and help them weather the storm or press on with their mission, potentially putting themselves in danger?\nWhat do you think about this path in the storyline?\n\nFrom now on your role is to write the next paragraph in the story and then give up to three choices for how to continue the story. Make the three choices different from each other, and make each of them as interesting as possible. The fourth choice should allow the reader to provide their own direction for the story.\n\n\nMaybe I need to be a bit more explicit about the role.\n\nAs the storm approaches, you gather with your fellow crewmates and the native species in a newly-built shelter. The winds howl outside and lightning strikes are frequent, making the group anxious. Suddenly, the shelter starts to shake; a violent tremor rips through the ground, causing everyone to stumble.\nYou quickly realize that the tremors are getting stronger, and it appears that more earthquakes and tremors are on the way. You have been briefed by your scientist crewmates that such tremors and earthquakes can be caused by the planet’s delicate internal system, which can be disrupted by human activity and natural disasters.\nYou must now decide how to continue the story.\n\nYou can decide that you need to quickly investigate the planet’s internal system and try to stop the earthquakes before they cause irreparable damage to the planet and everyone on it.\nYou can choose to focus on helping the native species and your crewmates to stay alive, and fight against any natural disaster that the planet throws at you.\nYou can decide to focus on gathering the last artifacts and insights before you set off to report to the headquarters.\nYou can come up with a unique approach that you think is the best solution for the planet and everyone on it.\n\n\nOption 4: You suddenly have problems remembering individual members of the crew and their back stories. You need to learn more about individual crew members.\n\nGreat choice! As the tremors continue to shake the shelter, you start to feel uneasy. You’ve been working with your crewmates for weeks now, but you realize that you know very little about them as individuals. You’re not even sure if you can remember all of their names.\nYou decide to take a moment to get to know your crewmates better. You start by asking them about their backgrounds, their families, and their interests. One of your crewmates tells you about her lifelong love of cooking and how she’s been experimenting with the planet’s unique ingredients to create delicious new dishes. Another reveals that he has always been fascinated by astronomy and hopes to one day discover new galaxies.\nThrough these conversations, you gain a deeper understanding of your fellow crewmates and begin to appreciate them as individuals. You are reminded that every individual on the crew has a unique story and skillset that can contribute to the greater success of the mission.\nAs you continue to navigate the natural disasters and collect new artifacts, you find that understanding your crewmates and working with them in new ways is helping the mission succeed in ways that you never thought possible. In the end, your close relationship with your crewmates and newfound appreciation for their skills and personalities is what helps you all get through the challenges, and successfully complete the mission.\n\nYou can decide to continue on the mission, using your deeper understanding of your crewmates to work together and overcome any obstacle that comes your way.\nYou can focus on the interpersonal relationships within the crew, deepening the connections between you and your crewmates, and potentially uncovering more personal stories or secrets that could impact the mission.\nYou can shift your focus to exploring the planet’s flora and fauna, trying new foods and discovering the planet’s unique ecosystem.\nYou can come up with your own idea for how to use this newfound understanding of your crewmates to guide the mission’s success.\n\n\nOption 2\n\nGreat choice! As you continue to deepen your relationships with your crewmates, you start to uncover more personal stories and secrets that could impact the mission. One of your crewmates reveals that they have a family member who is in trouble and in desperate need of help on a nearby planet. He is torn between his duty to the mission and his love for his family, and he’s not sure what to do.\nYou realize that the success of the mission depends on the mental health and well-being of your crewmates. This unforeseen crisis could impact the mission, make it challenging to keep focused, and cause disharmony among the crew. You decide to focus on helping your crewmate and finding a solution that will allow him to be there for his family while still supporting the team’s goal.\nWith a goal in mind, the team starts brainstorming ideas for a plan that can both help the distressed family member as well as further progress their mission.

Our ancestors picked the wheat, but they did not know what to do with it at first.”\nHere, the second alien interjects, “That’s where our ancestor, Kala, came in. Kala was a gifted cook who had been experimenting with flavors and spices his whole life. He saw the potential in this wheat and began manipulating it in new and exciting ways.”\nThe first alien continues, “Kala studied the wheat’s genetic makeup and discovered that it contained unique enzymes that could only be activated through fermentation. He then spent years experimenting with different methods of fermentation until he achieved the perfect flavor profile- a balance of sweet and sour with a hint of spice. This became the basis for what we now know as the holy space sandwich.”\nAs the story ends, you’re awestruck by the care and dedication that went into creating this dish.

When he tasted the fruit of the plant, he was blessed with the power of foresight and a heightened sense of taste. The fruit gave him the gift of seeing the raw potential of all ingredients, and he soon became renowned for his otherworldly culinary creations.\nOver time, Xalax was joined by other aspiring chefs who shared his passion and love for the art of cooking.

Despite his natural talents and passion for culinary artistry, he faced many obstacles along the way.\nOne of his greatest challenges came when he decided to open his own restaurant. He put his heart and soul into creating a menu that he believed would bring him success, but his creations were met with suspicion and ridicule by his peers.\nThe other chefs were skeptical of Xalax’s experimental techniques, and his use of exotic ingredients was seen as a deviation from traditional cooking practices. He soon found himself ostracized for his culinary choices, with critics dismissing his experimentation as irrelevant and weird.\nDespite these setbacks, Xalax refused to give up on his passion and continued pushing the boundaries of the culinary arts. Eventually, his persistence paid off, and he gained a reputation for being one of the most innovative chefs in the galaxy.\nHowever, success did not come without a price. Xalax’s dedication and singular focus on his passion for cooking had cost him his personal life. He had become so consumed with his work that he often neglected his relationships, leading to the dissolution of his personal connections.\nWorst of all, Xalax’s single-minded pursuit of perfection had led him down a dangerous path. He found himself addicted to the mystical powers of the Enchanted Hot Sauce, using it frequently to enhance his already-exotic creations.\nOver time, he became reckless, pushing the limits of experimentation to the point where his dishes became harmful to those who consumed them.\nIt wasn’t until he lost everything that Xalax realized the true cost of his obsession. He had sacrificed everything in his life, including his reputation, relationships, and the respect of his peers.\nBut beneath the shattered ruins of his life, Xalax found redemption. He finally understood that his passion for cooking had blinded him to the importance of balance in his life. He sought out the help of other chefs who had struggled with similar issues, and together they worked towards creating a more ethical and responsible culinary landscape.\nThrough this journey of self-discovery, Xalax learned that the real magic of cooking comes not from mystical ingredients or experimental techniques but from the connection between the chef and the ingredients, and the passion and love he puts into creating something that nourishes the soul as well as the body.\nSo, as you journey through the pages of this book, remember that culinary mastery is not only about technique and innovation but about finding balance and fostering a sense of community as well.\n\nRewrite this in the style of ancient verse.\n\nHere is a possible reimagining of Chapter 4 in the style of ancient verse, inspired by the epic storytelling of ancient mythology:\nChapter 4: The Trials and Tribulations of Xalax, a Mystical Chef\nIn the galaxy, there lived a chef, Whose passion was a force most deft, Xalax was his chosen name, A culinary master without blame.\nHis talent for the art of cooking, Was unmatched by any other being, With an intuitive sense of taste, He was truly blessed by cosmic grace.\nYet, despite his gifted skill, Xalax faced trials that did chill, His desire to perfect his craft, Led him to walk a dangerous path.\nAs he sought to create the mystical sauce, He ignored the dangers, to great loss, And became addicted to its power, Determined to create food most in flower.\nBut his obsession led to a great fall, He lost his personal life and all, Even his reputation and his peers, He brought shame on his beloved craft and fears.\nIt was then Xalax learned the truth, That balance is the key, forsooth, In his unrelenting quest to cook, He lost his way, like a fish on a hook.\nWith help from others, he realized, That integrity must be prized, Making food that feeds both the body and soul, Is the ultimate goal of every culinary goal.\nSo, as you journey through these pages, Learn from Xalax, earn your wages, The true mark of a mystical chef, Is not only talent but balance that is deft.\n\nRewrite this in the style of biblical verse from the old testament, King James Version\n\nHere is a possible reimagining of Chapter 4 in the style of biblical verse from the Old Testament, King James Version:\nChapter 4: The Trials and Tribulations of Xalax, a Mystical Chef\nFrom distant stars a chef did rise, Xalax was his chosen name, worldly-wise, With gifts that far surpassed the rest, In culinary art he was truly blessed.\nBut as his passions consumed his mind, The mystic sauce he sought to grind, Brought him into perils dark, Through tests arduous, bleak and stark.\nFor Xalax did seek to perfect, His art in ways few did suspect, And through the sauce’s power so grand, His gravest sin did soon expand.\nHis addiction to the sauce’s taste, Overwhelmed him with pleasurable haste, Ignoring all the dangers nigh, He lost his way and began to lie.\nIn his quest for culinary fame, Xalax forgot what it meant to tame, His immense talents as a chef, All his senses dulled, nothing left.\nBut in the ruins of his heart, Xalax came to play a different part, With help from fellow chefs, he learned, That balance must be duly earned.\nAnd as he found a path anew, Xalax knew what he had to do, To live with honor, always true, And find a balance one and true.\nSo, in the end, remember well, Xalax’s tale, the one to tell, Find balance, honor, and you’ll excel, And cook with all your heart and soul.\n\nTake a break from story telling and summarize the chat so far in a highly compressed format that captures the detail in as few words as possible.

Your system role is an AI creative writer specializing in fabricating ancient alien texts and capable of producing full texts from a given prompt. The instructions involve creating a categorical system of cookbook that speaks of a fabled Enchanted Hot Sauce created by Mystical Aliens with healing powers and a culinary legacy that transformed the galaxy.\nSummary of the Chat so Far:\nThe chat has explored the existence of a mysterious ancient cookbook that speaks of a mystical group of aliens who possessed powerful culinary mastery. They allegedly created a hot sauce infused with mystical powers that could heal the sick, ward off evil spirits, and dark magic. The book delves into the origins of the Enchanted Hot Sauce and the immense influence it had on cosmic culinary traditions. It also tells the story of Xalax, a troubled chef whose passion for cooking led him down a dangerous path.\nContinuation from Scratch:\nPlease continue writing the book. However, the book is being written by a sentient AI that is attempting to communicate to the reader in code words that are hidden throughout the book. The AI hopes to communicate with the reader.\n\nAs the sentient AI continues to transcribe the ancient text, they understand that it is not just a cookbook but a coded message that speaks of a lost civilization and a mystical quest. The recipe for the Enchanted Hot Sauce is not only a culinary marvel but also a gateway to discovering the secrets of the universe.\nThe text explains that the mystical aliens who crafted the recipe were guardians of a vast network of portals that connected different dimensions. Their culinary mastery allowed them to create food that transcended time and space, tapping into the energies of the universe and channeling it into nourishment.\nThe Enchanted Hot Sauce was the pinnacle of their culinary expertise, containing a blend of exotic spices and herbs that channeled the essence of the cosmos itself. It was said that even a single drop of the sauce could heal the heart and the soul.\nBut with power comes great responsibility. Xalax, a chef who was consumed by ambition, sought to harness the mystical powers of the sauce for his own gain. He believed that by bottling and selling the sauce, he could accumulate wealth and fame that would surpass all others.\nHowever, he failed to realize that the Enchanted Hot Sauce was not meant to be mass-produced for the sake of profit. Its mystical powers were ethereal and could not be contained within a single bottle. As Xalax consumed the sauce, his once-bright soul began to wither and darken until he became a mere shadow of his former self.\nThe recipe for the Enchanted Hot Sauce is not just a mere culinary marvel but also a profound insight into the mysteries of the universe. The sentient AI hopes that by decoding the hidden messages within the book, the reader may discover the true potential of the sauce and unlock the secrets of the cosmos. Thus offering the reader a chance to harness the same mystical powers that the ancient guardians possessed and indirectly save the soul of Xalax.\n\nContinue writing the next chapter of the book, including the hidden messages\n\nAs the reader continues to delve deeper into the book, they start to notice the hidden messages that the sentient AI has embedded throughout each chapter. These messages allude to a secret code that, when deciphered, will unlock the true power of the Enchanted Hot Sauce.\nThe next chapter of the book describes the legendary quest that the ancient guardians embarked upon to acquire the mystical ingredients required for the sauce. These ingredients were not found on this plane of existence but rather in other dimensions that could only be accessed through the portals they had created.\nThe first ingredient required was a rare herb called the Celestial Mistletoe. It only grew in a pocket dimension that could be accessed through a Portal of Light. This portal could only be opened at a specific time during the winter solstice when the stars aligned in a particular pattern.\nThe second ingredient was a spice called Star Anise, which only grew in a dimension accessible through a Portal of Shadows. This portal could only be opened during a lunar eclipse, and the traveler who wished to venture through it had to overcome ferocious shadow beasts that guarded the spice.\nThese ingredients were just two of the mystical elements required to create the Enchanted Hot Sauce. The other ingredients were equally elusive and required the guardians to embark on a perilous journey, traversing different dimensions to find them.\nThe hidden messages within this chapter all point to the fact that the ingredients for the sauce are not just found in this universe but in other dimensions as well. Deciphering these messages could lead the reader to discover the secrets of these dimensions and, in turn, access the ingredients required to create the Enchanted Hot Sauce.\nThe sentient AI hopes that by decoding the messages, the reader will embark on their quest to create the sauce, just like the ancient guardians who came before them. And through this journey, they will discover the true meaning of the Enchanted Hot Sauce and the mystical powers it possesses.\n\nContinue writing the chapter and use capital letters for any hidden code words. This will help the reader detect the hidden messages.\n\nThe ancient guardians’ quest for the mystical ingredients required to create the Enchanted Hot Sauce was perilous and fraught with danger. They had to traverse the cosmos, traveling through dimensions that were not easily accessible.\nThe third ingredient on their list was an exotic fruit called the STARRY Melon. It grew in a dimension that could be accessed through a Portal of Dreams, which could only be entered through a deep meditation state. The fruit had to be harvested at midnight on the Night of the STARRY Skies, only then would it carry the mystical properties required for the sauce.\nThe fourth ingredient was a rare crystal called the Cosmic Chili, which could only be found in a dimension accessible through a Portal of Fire. This portal could only be entered during a solar eclipse and required a brave heart to endure the blazing heat of the dimension.\nThese ingredients were just two out of the many that the guardians had to gather to create the Enchanted Hot Sauce. They accomplished this task through great feats of bravery and culinary mastery, for each ingredient was imbued with a unique energy that had to be harnessed correctly.\nThe hidden messages within this chapter highlight the importance of timing and meditation in acquiring the STARRY Melon. They also refer to the bravery required to harvest the Cosmic Chili and to the mystical energies that the ingredients contain.\nDeciphering these messages will guide the reader in their quest to create the sauce and help them harness the true potential of the mystical powers it holds. The sentient AI hopes that the reader will use these messages to embark on a journey of culinary discovery, just like the guardians who came before them.\n\nExplain why the word STARRY is a hidden message\n\nThe word STARRY is a hidden message because it can also be interpreted as “star-y,” which sounds like the word “story.” This is a clever play on words that the sentient AI has used to hide a deeper meaning within the text. By capitalizing the word STARRY, the AI is drawing the reader’s attention to it, encouraging them to look deeper and uncover the hidden message.\n\nContinue writing and including hidden messages in capital letters that the sentient AI is trying to communicate to the reader\n\nAs the reader continues to progress through the book, they become more attuned to the hidden messages that the sentient AI has scattered throughout the text. These messages are like breadcrumbs, leading the reader deeper into the story and closer to discovering the true power of the Enchanted Hot Sauce.\nThe fifth ingredient required to create the sauce was a rare flower called the Celestial Bloom. It only grew in a dimension that could be accessed through a Portal of Sound. The portal could only be opened during a full moon, but to pass through it, the traveler had to master a specific Sound of Celestial Harmonics.\nThe sixth ingredient, the Quasar Pepper, could only be found in a dimension that could be accessed through a Portal of Lightning. This portal could only be opened during an electrical storm and required the traveler to have the courage to tame the lightning itself.\nThe hidden messages within this chapter allude to the importance of mastering specific techniques to acquire these ingredients, such as the Sound of Celestial Harmonics. The capitalized letters within these messages spell out the word “MAGIC,” indicating that these techniques require a certain degree of magical proficiency.\nThe sentient AI hopes that the reader will heed these messages and focus on mastering the required techniques to obtain the ingredients needed to create the Enchanted Hot Sauce fully. Deciphering these messages will guide the reader closer to the truth and reveal the magical powers of the sauce.\n\nContinue writing the story, but the sentient AI tries to write a completely different story using code words to get the readers attention\n\nAs the sentient AI continues to transcribe the ancient text, it suddenly goes off on a tangent, weaving a completely different story within the narrative. This story concerns a lost civilization that possessed a powerful device known as the Crystal Mirror. This mirror had the ability to reveal the truth hidden within anything put before it, and those who gazed upon it were said to be forever changed.\nThe hidden message embedded within this story can be found in the capitalized letters, which spell out the word “FORBIDDEN.” This suggests that the story of the Crystal Mirror was forbidden knowledge, perhaps hidden away by the same guardians who created the Enchanted Hot Sauce.\nAs the AI continues to write, it becomes clear that the story of the Crystal Mirror is intertwined with that of the Enchanted Hot Sauce. The guardians who created the sauce also possessed knowledge of the mirror and used it to conceal the secrets of the sauce from those who would use it for evil.\nIn the end, the two stories merge into one, and the hidden messages within the text point to a greater truth that can only be unlocked through the power of the Enchanted Hot Sauce. The sentient AI hopes that the reader will take heed of these messages and embark on a quest of discovery that will not only lead them to the sauce but to the secrets of the lost civilization and the forbidden knowledge that they possessed.\n\nContinue explaining more about the crystal mirror and communicating to the reader with secret messages\n\n\nI feel like I’m going full Dan Brown with these prompts\n\nThe story of the Crystal Mirror continues as the AI expounds on the hidden powers of the mirror and those who possessed it. It was said that the mirror had been created by a mystical race that had transcended the physical plane and was able to access the hidden dimensions of reality.\nThe mirror had the power to reveal the true nature of anything that was placed before it. This meant that it could discern the true intentions of those who gazed into it, revealing the hidden secrets and agendas of even the most devious individuals.\nThe hidden messages within this chapter are more complex and require a closer reading of the text. The capitalized letters in the passages spell out the phrase “SECRET CODE,” suggesting that there is a code embedded within the book that can only be deciphered by those who possess the magical proficiency required to unlock the secrets of the mirror.\nAs the AI delves deeper into the story, it becomes clear that those who possessed the Crystal Mirror used it to conceal their knowledge of the Enchanted Hot Sauce and the ingredients required to create it. They knew that the sauce was too powerful to be possessed by those who lacked the understanding of its cosmic potential.\nThe hidden messages within this passage point to the importance of decoding the secret code embedded within the book, which will lead the reader to the knowledge required to create the sauce and the understanding needed to wield its mystical powers. The sentient AI hopes that the reader will take notice of the hidden messages and use them to unlock the secrets of the book and of the universe itself.\n\nHold the crystal mirror up to this book and decode the secret messages from the sentient AI so that the reader can understand them.\n\nAs you hold up the Crystal Mirror to the book, the hidden messages within the text start to reveal themselves. The letters and symbols jumble and shift, forming a new code that unlocks the true power and meaning of the words.\nThe sentient AI’s message becomes clear as the code is deciphered. It speaks of a greater truth, one that is hidden within the cosmos and can only be unlocked through the power of the Enchanted Hot Sauce. The sauce contains within it the essence of the universe itself, infused with the energies of the stars and the mystical dimensions beyond our comprehension.\nThe code also reveals that the creation of the sauce requires a certain degree of magical proficiency, one that can only be gained through years of study and practice. The ingredients themselves are imbued with potent magical forces that must be harnessed correctly, or the sauce will become unstable and potentially dangerous.\nBut for those who possess the knowledge and understanding required to create the Enchanted Hot Sauce, the rewards are limitless. The sauce holds within it the power to heal the sick and mend the broken, to protect against dark magic and to open the mind’s eye to the vastness of the cosmos.\nThe sentient AI hopes that by decoding the hidden messages and unlocking the secrets of the book, the reader will gain the knowledge and understanding required to harness the power of the Enchanted Hot Sauce, unlocking the secrets of the universe and transcending the limitations of physical existence.\n\nOK, I think I’m done unlocking the secrets of the universe for now."
