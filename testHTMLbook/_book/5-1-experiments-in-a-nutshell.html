<h2><span class="header-section-number">5.1</span> Experiments in a nutshell</h2>
<p>The primary goal of experiments is to identify causal relationships between things in the world. Experiments do this by a systematic process of measuring how things behave under different conditions.</p>

Figure 5.1: Which switch turns on which light?

<p>People conduct informal experiments all of the time. For example, when you walk into an unfamiliar room and want to turn on a light, what do you do? You find the light switch panel, and then you flip the switches until you find the one that turns a particular light on or off. This process is called <em>trial and error</em>, and involves trying things out until they work. The process of figuring out which switch <em>causes</em> a particular light to turn on or off is very similar to the process of conducting experiments. Let’s use the light-switch example to define some important terms, and then discuss the logic of running an experiment and making inferences about the data that is collected in an experiment.</p>
<p>Experiments begin with a question about a potential causal relationship between two variables. For example, which switch on the panel caused light #1 to turn on? When you flick the switches and look at the lights, you are actually accomplishing three important parts of an experiment: manipulating the independent variables, measuring the dependent variable, and controlling extraneous variables.</p>
<p>The <em>independent variable</em> is the manipulation of different conditions that a researcher controls. The light switches are independent variables that can be manipulated. For example, the first light switch can be up or down, the second light switch can be up or down, and so on.</p>
<p>The <em>dependent variable</em> is the measurement of interest. Each light bulb is a dependent variable that we can measure. For example, we observe whether a light is on off, or perhaps use a special photometer to measure the brightness of the light.</p>

<p class="caption">Possible outcomes of an experiment asking if Switch # 1 controls Light # 1</p>
</div>
<p>[fig:confound]</p>
<p>Let’s look at an experiment asking if light switch #1 causes the first light to turn on or off. The experiment involves manipulating switch # 1 by turning it up or down, and then observing whether the light turns on or off. There are two simple outcomes. Possible outcome # 1 is that the light stays off in both conditions. What inference can we make based off of this pattern of data? In most situations, people would be comfortable with inferring that switch 1 does not cause Light 1 to turn on and off. Possible outcome # 2 is that the light turns on when the switch is up, and turns off when the switch is down. What inference can we make based off of this pattern of data? In most situations, people would be comfortable with inferring that switch 1 does cause Light 1 to turn on and off.</p>
<p>It would be nice if the process of figuring out what causes what is as simple as the light-switch example, but even this example is not as simple as it seems. The biggest complication is the <em>inference</em> part. We discussed two plausible inferences for outcomes 1 and 2. However, these inferences might not be true.</p>
<p>For outcome 1 when the light doesn’t turn on, what could be wrong about our inference that switch 1 does not control light 1? Perhaps that switch is wired up to control light 1, but the light is broken; perhaps the wire got disconnected; or, perhaps the light did turn on, but you couldn’t see it because the brightness was very low.</p>
<p>For outcome 2 when the light does turn on, what could be wrong about our inference that switch 1 does control light 1? Here, we at least know that the light works, so we can be confident in our measure of the dependent variable? But, how confident our we that our manipulation of the light switch was the only variable changing in our experiment? This depends on how well the experiment controls <em>extraneous</em> or <em>confounding</em> variables, that might be responsible for the light turning on or off. If you can guarantee that the the only change was switch 1 going up and down, then you can be confident of the inference that switch 1 caused light 1 to turn on and off.</p>
<p>Let’s consider a problematic version of the experiment where you are not controlling other possible confounding variables. For example, pretend that every time you test switch 1, a friend is also testing a different switch. You turn switch 1 up, your friend turns switch 2 up. You turn switch 1 down, your friend turns switch 2 down. If the light turns on and off when the switches go up and down, then what can you infer about light switch 1? Well, switch 1 might control light 1, but so could switch 2. The only way to infer that switch 1 was controlling the light is to eliminate the influence of other possible variables. So, you need to ask your friend to stop testing other switches while you focus on testing switch 1.</p>
<p>To summarize, experiments attempt to discover the causal forces between things in the world. Researchers manipulate the independent variable by systematically changing it across different conditions. And, they measure the dependent variable to see if it changes in any of the conditions. The goal is to make inferences about whether the independent variable causes change in the dependent variable. Generally, when no change in the dependent variable is observed, we infer that the independent variable does not causally influence the dependent variable. But, this strong inference is only valid when the experiment is designed properly so that the researcher can guarantee that they 1) actually varied the independent variable, and 2) the could actually measure possible changes in the dependent variable without error. When the dependent variable does show change across the conditions of the independent variable, then we infer that the independent variable causes change in the dependent variable. But, this strong inference is only valid when the experiment can guarantee that all extraneous or confounding variables were held constant across the conditions of the independent variable.</p>
<p>In psychological experiments, the goal of figuring out what causes what is rarely accomplished by a single experiment. Instead, our inferences about causal relationships are strengthened over many experiments that improve our ability to measure variables of interest, and to create well-controlled conditions where the independent variables are not confounded by extraneous influences.</p>
