## Expertise: Not much \| Usefulness: ? \| Audience: notes to self
:::

I spent the morning coding up some ways to automate header images, not sure I saved myself time, it was equal parts fun and frustrating.

This post is an an excuse to try out a simple header, and to enable RSS feeds on this blog. What will happen?

Following these [quarto RSS](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/website-blog.html#rss-feed) steps.

## Done?

That was easy. Just need to publish this and see if I can subscribe to myself?
