Expertise: 0 Usefulness: ? Audience: notes to self

I love music: listening to it and making it. I've had increasingly less time for music, and am trying to find more time for it. So, as a part of learning mastodon I created an account for my music interests:

[https://bbs.crumplab.com/\@homophony](https://bbs.crumplab.com/@homophony)

It's only been a week, but I'm having lots of fun connecting with music makers on the #fediverse. This could mean more overall music, which would be great!

When I first tried mastodon a week ago I had no idea about activitypub, or the broader fediverse. I didn't realize there are many different "platforms" compatible or semi-compatible with the [activitypub protocol](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/). This means that user accounts on one platform like mastodon can interact with user accounts on another platform like [pixelfed](https://pixelfed.org) (open-source version of instagram for picture sharing). There a [lots of platforms in the fediverse](https://github.com/emilebosch/awesome-fediverse), including [funkwhale](https://funkwhale.audio) for audio and music sharing.

## Spinning up

Installation dev instructions <https://docs.funkwhale.audio/installation/>

Other instructions, possibly helpful for a droplet setup.

<https://geek-cookbook.funkypenguin.co.nz/recipes/funkwhale/>

Leaving this for another time...back.

## Start trying

How long will this take? I was hoping to do this all on digital ocean. Will try develop instructions. Starting at 6:42.

Ok, that was super easy.

I created a new Ubuntu droplet on digital ocean. Logged into the terminal by website. I followed these steps from the quick install.

``` {.bash}
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install curl
sudo sh -c "$(curl -sSL https://get.funkwhale.audio/)"
```

Made an A name to create a new subdomain for my pod. Pressed enter a couple times to say YES during install. Took about 15 minutes, mostly waiting. Now I have a funkwhale pod. huh.

What do I do with this?

## musicbrainz

-   downloaded the musicbrainz app

<https://musicbrainz.org/>

Might have to use this for metadata? After making an account over here, I realize this is mostly for tagging .mp3 libraries of existing music so it is easy to upload with tags.

I could add my own artist info here I guess. Not sure how useful it will be yet for adding metadata around individual tracks I create. It could be very useful, or not. Need to learn more about associating new music audio files I make with all the necessary metadata.

## Issue collection

I have destroyed the droplet.

-   Made my admin account "homophony", which worked all fine and dandy. However, this meant that I couldn't use that handle to create channels and share under that artist name.

-   musicbrainz is interesting and complicated. I should consider listing exist discography there. It seems to be mostly for uploading digital music collections, which is not what I'm interested in doing. Funkwhale could be altogether more than I need it for. Still...curious.

Restarted the droplet...waiting through the install.
