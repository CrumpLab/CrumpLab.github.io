I often create messy annotated bibliographies for sets of readings. This will be a quick post for me to work through my writing and R Markdown process for creating annotated bibs. I have a feeling that I could make the process easier for myself. But, I need to kick some tires first.

## Zotero Copy/Paste Method

This is the method that I am starting with, and it could be the one I end with too.

1.  Use [zotero](https://www.zotero.org) for reference management.

-   Make a folder for my readings
-   Add citation entries to zotero for each reading

2.  Copy/paste references out of Zotero into R markdown.

3.  Write an annotation underneath the citation and move on.

I usually separate citations with a horizontal line. The look and feel is:

### Pros/Cons

Pros: It's fast to copy/paste citations out of Zotero.

Cons: The citations are not formatted by csl, they could be made more pretty looking. No reference list generated. No header added to table of contents.

## Cite in text method

1.  export .bib file from Zotero
2.  cite individual papers and write annotation

Looks like:

Some comments about the paper

------------------------------------------------------------------------

@bowersStudentDishonestyIts1964

Some comments about the paper

------------------------------------------------------------------------

@drakeWhyStudentsCheat1941

Some comments about the paper

### Pros/Cons

Also fast, and generates a reference list. However, the full citation is not printed in the main text.

## What I want?

1.  Fast and easy
2.  Title listed in TOC
3.  Full-citation listed in main text
4.  Reference list printed at end

Maybe something that looks like this.

### When Opportunity Knocks: College Students' Cheating Amid the COVID-19 Pandemic

::: apa
```{r, results="asis"}
crumplab::bib2md("jenkinsWhenOpportunityKnocks2022","AcademicIntegrity.bib")
```
:::

@jenkinsWhenOpportunityKnocks2022 provide both a historical summary of the cheating literature, and present new data about cheating behavior during COVID-19.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Ghost-Students and the New Wave of Online Cheating for Community College Students

::: apa
```{r, results="asis"}
crumplab::bib2md("hollisGhoststudentsNewWave2018","AcademicIntegrity.bib")
```
:::

@hollisGhoststudentsNewWave2018 discuss contract-cheating and "ghost-students" who are hired to complete coursework.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Pros/Cons

This is getting closer to something I would use. It's not too clunky. Perhaps a function to further automate the process.

```{r, echo=TRUE}
bib2annotate <- function(cite_key,
                   bib_file,
                   csl_file = "apa.csl",
                   header_level="###"){

  import_bib <- RefManageR::ReadBib(bib_file)
  get_title <- import_bib[[cite_key]]$title
  get_title <- stringr::str_remove_all(get_title,"[{}]")
  single_citation <- RefManageR::toBiblatex(import_bib[[cite_key]])
  
  cat(c(header_level, " ", get_title, "\n\n"))
  cat(c("::: {.apa}","\n"))
  stevemisc::print_refs(paste(single_citation,collapse=""),csl=csl_file)
  cat(c(":::","\n\n"))
  cat(c("Citation key for ","@",cite_key,": ",cite_key), sep="")

}
```

```{r, results="asis", echo=TRUE}
bib2annotate("ivesYourStudentsAre2020","AcademicIntegrity.bib")
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

This will work well enough for now (note to self to add bib2annotate to crumplab functions.)
