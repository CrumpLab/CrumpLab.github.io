  abstract = {Two of the best known eponymous phenomena in memory research were carried out as dissertations in the same era at the same university, each supervised by an influential researcher working within the Gestalt framework. Both examined the influence of unexpected events on memory. Bluma Zeigarnik (Psychologische Forschung, 9, 1–85, 1927) first reported that memory is better for interrupted tasks than for completed tasks, a phenomenon long known as the Zeigarnik effect. Hedwig von Restorff (Psychologische Forschung, 18, 299–342, 1933) first reported that memory is better for isolated than for non-isolated pieces of information, a phenomenon long known as the von Restorff effect. In this article, I present: (1) a biographical sketch of the researcher behind each phenomenon, (2) a description of their dissertation research, and (3) an evaluation of the current status of each phenomenon.},

Learning trials and transcription score correlated .72. Learning and relearning trials correlated .78. The sequence of unilateral trials preliminary to coordinated trials is favored. The interpolated keyboard practice gave either no advantage or positive interference with learning. Bibliography of 26 titles. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved)},

  abstract = {Notes that the fundamental fact about memory seems to be that it possesses two qualitatively different types of knowledge, specific and general, selectively used to perform tasks with respect to particular events and with respect to the generic identity of objects. The author contends that dichotomizing memory in this way seriously miscasts its essential nature, and results in mistaken assumptions about its subsidiary functions. It is proposed that the prime functions of memory are the construction of psychological experiences and their preservation. The construction of an experience of a stimulus is performed through the same set of principles both in remembering specific events from the past and in identifying or classifying present stimuli. It is further contended that memory preserves only one type of information, namely whatever a person does in constructing an experience of a stimulus. Fundamentally, the author argues that memory is unitary in structure and operation. He describes a formulation of memory, SCAPE (Selective Construction And Preservation of Experiences). This theory is a marriage of ideas including instance theory, the episodic-processing account of concept acquisition, the attribution theory of remembering, skill transfer, and transfer-appropriate processing.
