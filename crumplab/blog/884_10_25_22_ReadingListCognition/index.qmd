One of my ongoing projects is an [open-educational resource for a survey course in cognitive psychology](https://crumplab.com/cognition). The project currently includes a textbook, course website, slides, and assignment suggestions under a creative commons license (CC-BY-SA 4.0). The textbook has nine chapters, and at some point I plan to add a few more. As it stands, when I teach this course, we transition from textbook readings toward reading primary research articles. To supplement and encourage more reading of primary research, I'm considering adding a suggested reading list section to the textbook. The purpose of this blog post is to draft some reading lists, and think about how I would curate and present them.

I think I have two general problems to solve:

1.  Picking articles to go on the list (and considering why these/not those).
2.  Maintaining and publishing the list with preferred software tools, like zotero and quarto.

Ideally, I think I want a zotero folder with sub-folders for different topics in cognition, each full of recommended papers to read. I already use zotero, and it can generate .bib files for each folder, which I can pipe into quarto and print out somewhere. There's wrinkles though.

Let me count the ways. Let's say I have 10-25 recommended articles per chapter. I could put them all in a single .bib file, and then use \[nocite\](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/footnotes-and-citations.html#including-uncited-items) to print them all to a reference list at the end of a chapter. This will be a long undifferentiated reference list in alphabetical order. I could probably sort it differently with CSL.

I remembered that I already started an "additional reading" section in the Eugenics and Psychology chapter. I don't like how it is presently formatted on the page, but I do like that it appears as a section in the chapter. Hmmm.

Revisiting that chapter I see that I tried two things. First, I wrote a code chunk to automatically generate a reading list from selected .bib entries in a .bib file. But, I guess I didn't like how that worked out, because I ended up typing out the references directly.

Here's a version of the code chunk:

```{r}
#| eval: TRUE
#| results: "asis"
#| messages: FALSE
#| warning: FALSE

library(dplyr)
load_bib <- bib2df::bib2df(file="memory_timeline.bib")

selected_bib <- load_bib %>%
  filter(BIBTEXKEY %in% c(
    "atkinsonHumanMemoryProposed1968",
    "baddeleyWorkingMemory1974",
    "craikLevelsProcessingFramework1972"))

bib2df::df2bib(selected_bib,file = "temp.bib")

stevemisc::print_refs("temp.bib",csl="apa-annotated-bibliography.csl")
```

This is OK. What are some other options.

## Cite the refs in text.

I guess the simplest option is to cite the references in text the normal way.
