The story picked up more attention than I anticipated. I shared the story as part of a course assessment writing exercise, which has now been completed, and the original post is no longer available.\n\nPart of my course assessment exercise was to learn more about the literature on cheating behavior. I conducted a short literature review on that topic and am posting brief notes about a few of the papers.\n\nFor teaching psychology, I found this paper to be most relevant and current:\n\nJenkins, B.

The main findings were: (a) the inci dence of cheating among these graduate subjects was found to be at least as extensive as reported in prior studies among undergraduate students?at least eighteen of the forty-five (40%) graduate subjects cheated on the quizzes; (b) pressure to obtain good grades was the main reason subjects felt they cheated in the past; (c) there was a lack of consensus whether certain behaviors constitute cheating; (d) no significant personality differences were found between cheaters and non-cheaters; (e) the MMPI results provided evidence in support of the doctrine of specificity of moral behavior.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBaird Jr, J.

A questionnnaire measuring 7 subject variables and 33 specific behaviors was administered to 200 students. The finding that about 75% of those surveyed had cheated in college was interpreted as supporting an hypothesized trend toward increasing dishonesty. Data on approval and guilt, reasons for cheating, reactions to cheating, and specific techniques were included. It was found that sex, year in shcool, grade point average, academic major, fraternity-sorority membership, and extracurricular participation were significantly related to cheating. The conclusions supported the importance of traditional explanatory variables and suggested an interpretation based on attribution theory.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNuss, E.

This research demonstrates that cheating is prevalent and that some forms of cheating have increased dramatically in the last 30 years. This research also suggests that although both individual and contextual factors influence cheating, contextual factors, such as students' perceptions of peers' behavior, are the most powerful influence. In addition, an institution's academic integrity programs and policies, such as honor codes, can have a significant influence on students' behavior. Finally, we offer suggestions for managing cheating from students' and faculty members' perspectives.\n\nTable 1 shows Self-Admitted Cheating---Summary Statistics which range from 44 to 82%.\n\n```{r}\nknitr::include_graphics(\"imgs/StudentTable3.png\")\n```\n\n```{r}\nknitr::include_graphics(\"imgs/FacultyTable4.png\")\n```\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBowers, W.

My employer was paying for the online class but I should have remembered that I would be the one who'd have to take the classes in the end. I didn't think about it . . . caused me a panic attack. . . . I took some of the classes and did some of the projects but I knew from the beginning that there was no way I could take the online classes and complete them myself. After having that epiphany, I realized that I'd be on the hook for part of the course fee if I didn't take my online classes and complete them (yes, my employer would only pay if I passed the class) . . . Anyway, I did a bit of research and found No Need To Study. Hiring them was the best decision ever! No Need To Study works lightning fast; it is like they know the classes inside out, taking my classes in record time. I got my classes done! My employer paid and I have the certifications now.\"\n\n<https://www.noneedtostudy.com/take-my-online-class/> <https://acemyassignment.com/> <https://www.paymetodoyourhomework.com/>\n\nHiring ghost students to take online classes appears to be big business.

Denial of Responsibility\n2.  Denial of Injury\n3.  Denial of Victim\n4.  Condemnation of the Condemner\n5.  Appeal to higher loyalties\n\nThis theory was developed in the context of juvenile delinquency and often applied to academic misconduct.\n\nTable 1 is reasons for Academic misconduct from a sample of university students from 6 institutions in Romania.\n\nFactor analysis suggests student reasons have a single dimension, not five dimensions.\n\nSuggests Achievement Goal Theory as a better model (Urdan, 1997).\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDaumiller, M., & Janke, S.
