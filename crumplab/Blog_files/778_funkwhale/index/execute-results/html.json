Audience: notes to self\n\nI love music: listening to it and making it. I've had increasingly less time for music, and am trying to find more time for it. So, as a part of learning mastodon I created an account for my music interests:\n\n[https://bbs.crumplab.com/\\@homophony](https://bbs.crumplab.com/@homophony)\n\nIt's only been a week, but I'm having lots of fun connecting with music makers on the #fediverse. This could mean more overall music, which would be great!\n\nWhen I first tried mastodon a week ago I had no idea about activitypub, or the broader fediverse. I didn't realize there are many different \"platforms\" compatible or semi-compatible with the [activitypub protocol](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/). This means that user accounts on one platform like mastodon can interact with user accounts on another platform like [pixelfed](https://pixelfed.org) (open-source version of instagram for picture sharing). There a [lots of platforms in the fediverse](https://github.com/emilebosch/awesome-fediverse), including [funkwhale](https://funkwhale.audio) for audio and music sharing.\n\n## Funkwhale notes\n\nUsing this space for note collection on funkwhale.\n\nMain site: <https://funkwhale.audio>\n\nFunkwhale forum: <https://forum.funkwhale.audio>\n\nFunkwhale on mastodon: [https://fosstodon.org/\\@funkwhale](https://fosstodon.org/@funkwhale){.uri}\n\nDashboard of Funkwhale pods <https://network.funkwhale.audio/dashboards/d/overview/funkwhale-network-overview?orgId=1&refresh=2h>\n\n## Spinning up\n\nInstallation dev instructions <https://docs.funkwhale.audio/installation/>\n\nOther instructions, possibly helpful for a droplet setup.\n\n<https://geek-cookbook.funkypenguin.co.nz/recipes/funkwhale/>\n\nLeaving this for another time...back.\n\n## Start trying\n\nHow long will this take? I was hoping to do this all on digital ocean. Will try develop instructions. Starting at 6:42.\n\nOk, that was super easy.\n\nI created a new Ubuntu droplet on digital ocean. Logged into the terminal by website. I followed these steps from the quick install.\n\n    sudo apt-get update\n    sudo apt-get install curl\n    sudo sh -c \"$(curl -sSL https://get.funkwhale.audio/)\"\n\nMade an A name to create a new subdomain for my pod. Pressed enter a couple times to say YES during install. Took about 15 minutes, mostly waiting. Now I have a funkwhale pod. huh.\n\nWhat do I do with this?\n\n![](images/Screen%20Shot%202022-11-12%20at%207.27.54%20AM.png)\n\n## musicbrainz\n\n- downloaded the musicbrainz app\n\n<https://musicbrainz.org/>\n\nMight have to use this for metadata?\n\n## Issue collection\n\nI have destroyed the droplet.\n\n- Made my admin account \"homophony\", which worked all fine and dandy. However, this meant that I couldn't use that handle to create channels and share under that artist name.\n\n- musicbrainz is interesting and complicated. I should consider listing exist discography there. It seems to be mostly for uploading digital music collections, which is not what I'm interested in doing. Funkwhale could be altogether more than I need it for. Still...curious.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
