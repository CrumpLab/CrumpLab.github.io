The project currently includes a textbook, course website, slides, and assignment suggestions under a creative commons license (CC-BY-SA 4.0). The textbook has nine chapters, and at some point I plan to add a few more. As it stands, when I teach this course, we transition from textbook readings toward reading primary research articles. To supplement and encourage more reading of primary research, I'm considering adding a suggested reading list section to the textbook. The purpose of this blog post is to draft some reading lists, and think about how I would curate and present them.\n\nI think I have two general problems to solve:\n\n1.  Picking articles to go on the list (and considering why these/not those).\n2.  Maintaining and publishing the list with preferred software tools, like zotero and quarto.\n\nIdeally, I think I want a zotero folder with sub-folders for different topics in cognition, each full of recommended papers to read. I already use zotero, and it can generate .bib files for each folder, which I can pipe into quarto and print out somewhere. There's wrinkles though.\n\nLet me count the ways. Let's say I have 10-25 recommended articles per chapter. I could put them all in a single .bib file, and then use \\[nocite\\](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/footnotes-and-citations.html#including-uncited-items) to print them all to a reference list at the end of a chapter. This will be a long undifferentiated reference list in alphabetical order. I could probably sort it differently with CSL.\n\nI remembered that I already started an \"additional reading\" section in the Eugenics and Psychology chapter. I don't like how it is presently formatted on the page, but I do like that it appears as a section in the chapter. Hmmm.\n\nRevisiting that chapter I see that I tried two things. First, I wrote a code chunk to automatically generate a reading list from selected .bib entries in a .bib file. But, I guess I didn't like how that worked out, because I ended up typing out the references directly.\n\nHere's a version of the code chunk:\n\n\n::: {.cell messages='false'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(dplyr)\nload_bib <- bib2df::bib2df(file=\"memory_timeline.bib\")\n\nselected_bib <- load_bib %>%\n  filter(BIBTEXKEY %in% c(\n    \"atkinsonHumanMemoryProposed1968\",\n    \"baddeleyWorkingMemory1974\",\n    \"craikLevelsProcessingFramework1972\"))\n\nbib2df::df2bib(selected_bib,file = \"temp.bib\")\n\nstevemisc::print_refs(\"temp.bib\",csl=\"apa-annotated-bibliography.csl\")\n```\n\nAtkinson, R.

It feels sticky because I'm thinking about how content and style come together, but I haven't totally sorted out what content options I want.\n\nMinimally, I think I want the citation and the option to add notes about the reading. This is pretty much what I have in the above table. I can write any notes about a paper in zotero and have them included in the .bib file. This way the .bib file acts as a little database, which also offers opportunities for search and presentation. For example, the above table adds a date column read from the bib file.\n\n## Trying to get interactive tables that process markdown citations\n\nWhich, reminds me, I need to double-check if I can make the date column sortable. This should be possible with:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nDT::datatable(selected_bib)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n```{=html}\n<div class=\"datatables html-widget html-fill-item-overflow-hidden html-fill-item\" id=\"htmlwidget-8dffa00820364c8b86d8\" style=\"width:100%;height:auto;\"></div>\n<script type=\"application/json\" data-for=\"htmlwidget-8dffa00820364c8b86d8\">{\"x\":{\"filter\":\"none\",\"vertical\":false,\"data\":[[\"1\",\"2\",\"3\"],[\"[@atkinsonHumanMemoryProposed1968]\",\"[@baddeleyWorkingMemory1974]\",\"[@craikLevelsProcessingFramework1972]\"],[1968,1974,1972],[\"Human Memory: A Proposed System and Its Control Processes\",\"Working Memory\",\"Levels of Processing: A Framework for Memory Research\"],[\"This is a classic paper because...\",\"\",\"\"]],\"container\":\"<table class=\\\"display\\\">\\n  <thead>\\n    <tr>\\n      <th> <\\/th>\\n      <th>CITATION<\\/th>\\n      <th>DATE<\\/th>\\n      <th>TITLE<\\/th>\\n      <th>NOTE<\\/th>\\n    <\\/tr>\\n  <\\/thead>\\n<\\/table>\",\"options\":{\"columnDefs\":[{\"className\":\"dt-right\",\"targets\":2},{\"orderable\":false,\"targets\":0}],\"order\":[],\"autoWidth\":false,\"orderClasses\":false}},\"evals\":[],\"jsHooks\":[]}</script>\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThat works, but it doesn't render the citations. I feel like I have been here before with the [Semantic librarian project](https://www.semanticlibrarian.com).\n\nSigh, looks like this is an open issue: <https://github.com/rstudio/DT/issues/748>.\n\nOk, let's try <https://glin.github.io/reactable/>.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#reactable::reactable(selected_bib)\n```\n:::\n\n\nThis doesn't render the citations either. But, is there hope? Perhaps custom-rendering: <https://glin.github.io/reactable/articles/custom-rendering.html>. Tried some stuff, didn't work.\n\n### Try stuff\n\nNone of thie stuff I tried here worked, deleting it. I'm also reminding myself that the .pdf version of the book chapters won't be able to have interactive tables. So, I'm pausing this tangent.\n\n## Minimal Example\n\nThe goal for this example is to pick 10-20 readings from cognitive psychology that could appear in the [first chapter](https://crumplab.com/cognition/textbook/C1_What_is_Cognition.html), and then print the table here. I'm going to pick some papers that could be interesting for this chapter, and then print the table here to a sense of look and feel. Heads over to zotero to make another folder within a folder.\n\nOK, I slammed together 13 papers. I can export them easily as a .bib file, load them in and print them as a table sorted by date. I'm less certain about how to add additional citation data to each entry, such as a note field. Let's see.\n\nI rarely use the notes feature in Zotero, so I just discovered that if I write notes for an entry, then I can export them as part of the bib file, and they appear as a note entry. That's convenient. I could imagine having really long notes for the some of the paper, and that wouldn't fit space-wise in the table very well. Could have notes as tooltips, or make the table scroll. Will come to that later. Let's add some notes and print out the table.\n\nI added some notes, some longer, some shorter. Curious to see what the table looks like.\n\n\n::: {.cell messages='false'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nload_bib <- bib2df::bib2df(file=\"C1_Cognition_reading.bib\")\n\nselected_bib <- load_bib %>%\n  select(BIBTEXKEY,\n         DATE,\n         TITLE,\n         NOTE) %>%\n  rowwise() %>%\n  mutate(BIBTEXKEY = paste(\"[@\",BIBTEXKEY,\"]\",sep=\"\",collapse=\"\"),\n         DATE = as.numeric(DATE),\n         TITLE = stringr::str_remove_all(TITLE,\"[{}]\"),\n         NOTE = case_when(is.na(NOTE) == TRUE ~ \"\",\n                          is.na(NOTE) == FALSE ~ NOTE)\n         ) %>%\n  rename(CITATION = BIBTEXKEY) %>%\n  arrange(desc(DATE))\n\nknitr::kable(selected_bib)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n|CITATION                                    | DATE|TITLE                                                                                                                                      |NOTE                                                                                                                                                                              |\n|:-------------------------------------------|----:|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|[@jamiesonInstanceTheoryDomaingeneral2022]  | 2022|Instance Theory as a Domain-General Framework for Cognitive Psychology                                                                     |An integrative review paper discussing how instance theories of cognition have been developed and applied across domains in cognition.                                            |\n|[@pratherWhatCanCognitive2022]              | 2022|What Can Cognitive Science Do for People?                                                                                                  |A short read raising important questions about how cognitive science should benefit people, with brief discussion of historical and present social justice issues.                |\n|[@raynerMuchReadLittle2016]                 | 2016|So Much to Read, So Little Time How Do We Read, and Can Speed Reading Help?                                                                |Discusses the cognitive psychology of reading processes and abilities and evaluates claims about speed-reading.
