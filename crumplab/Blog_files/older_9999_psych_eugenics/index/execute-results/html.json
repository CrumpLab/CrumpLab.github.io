I have more recently attempted to organize some of this information across two chapters in my introductory textbook to cognitive psychology:\n\n-   [Eugenics and Psychology](https://www.crumplab.com/cognition/textbook/eugenics-and-psychology.html)\n-   [Intelligence Testing](https://www.crumplab.com/cognition/textbook/intelligence-testing.html)\n\nIn summer 2022 I had a eugenics reading project, go here for a big list of books <https://crumplab.com/blog/post_990_6_28_22_eugenicsbooks/>.\n\nAlso, in October 2021 as a part of their [apology to people of color](https://www.apa.org/about/policy/racism-apology), the APA compiled a useful list of the historical involvement of psychologists in eugenics and other injustices: <https://www.apa.org/about/apa/addressing-racism/historical-chronology>. \n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](img/eugenics.jpg){fig-align='center' width=50%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nI'm working through the task of learning about influences of eugenics on psychology and society. As a part of this, I'm documenting the eugenics views held by many psychologists, as well as connections between psychologists and eugenics. I will keep updating this page as I document the connections. There are many connections, it will take some time. So far, this is an emerging disorganized collection of factoids.\n\nA major overarching goal of compiling and documenting connections between psychology and eugenics is to better understand how strucutural eugenics and racism in the discipline of Psychology has shaped and continues to shape the field, both in terms of the questions it asks, and who gets to ask them.\n\n## Sir Francis Galton\n\n-   Inventor of eugenics\n-   effectively initiates individual differences psychology, for the purposes of eugenics\n-   Obviously much more can be said about Galton...\n\n## Karl Pearson\n\n-   Eminent Statistician. Inventor of many common statistics (e.g., Pearson's R)\n-   Galton appointed Pearson as the first Director of his Eugenics Laboratory at University College London, this is still in use today\n-   The depths of Pearson's eugenics are apparent in his length effort to measure jewish children like animals, and apply his statistical tools to eliminating \"bad\" jews from immigrated to the UK [@pearsonProblemAlienImmigration1925]. This reference is part I of III, and continues for several hundred pages. To my mind, this work is obviously used as a blueprint by the Nazi's.\n\n## Ronald Fisher\n\n-   fill in refs\n\n## Alexander Graham Bell & Bell Labs\n\n-   Notable figure who was a prominent eugenicist\n-   Bell labs became central to the development of many communication technologies, and numerous important figures in the emerging discipline of cognitive science worked at Bell Labs.\n-   I need to look more into the culture of eugenics at Bell labs, but perhaps not surprisingly there appears to be one, e.g., <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Shockley>\n\n## Membership lists\n\nI haven't found too many membership lists yet about affiliations with eugenics societies. So, just a few screenshots for now:\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](img/EugenicsCommittee.png){fig-align='center' width=425}\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](img/EugenicalNews.png){fig-align='center' width=396}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## American Psychological Presidents (first 50)\n\n-   @yakushkoEugenicsItsEvolution2019 writes that 31 APA presidents between 1892 -1947 were affiliated with or leaders in eugenics movements. Need to fill this list out (also it extends past 1947 as we will see)\n\n### 1892 Granville Stanley Hall\n\n-   Noted as joining as new active member of the Eugenics Record Office in the Eugenical News\n-   Founded the \"Journal of Race Development\", see @blattBringOutBest2004\n-   on the point of view toward primitive races @hallPointViewPrimitive1910\n\n### 1893 George Trumball Ladd\n\n-   his presidential address is published in the first issue and volume of Psychological Review. He does not use the word eugenics, but appears to dogwhistle to the eugenicists in the room in his closing paragraphs about improving society. Also, many of the authors in the first issue of Psyc Review, were eugenicists\n-   contributing editor and author at Journal of Race Development\n\n### 1895 James McKeen Cattell\n\n-   [wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_McKeen_Cattell)\n-   Founded Psychological Review, as journal of APA\n-   bought Science, editor for 50 years\n-   APA president 1895\n-   Eugenicist, attempted to development intelligence tests that didn't quite work out, presumably for the purposes of eugenics. This is a nice example of efforts that pre-date Binet's IQ test to develop \"scientific\" mental tests for the purposes of eugenics.\n-   CATTELL, J. M . Families of American Men of Science. Pop.

His Education as the Psychologist Sees It (1920), for instance, was part of a successful nationwide postwar marketing campaign advocating the use of new group \"mental testing\" techniques in American schools. Here, Pillsbury uncritically combined past eugenic twin-studies with the new \"Army Alpha and Beta\" intelligence testing data. Surprisingly, his personal conclusion after thirty-three years of teaching is \"that one can never produce intelligence by education, that one must begin much farther back in actually insuring the birth of intelligent people\" (p. 46). \\[p. 525\\] At this time, however, Pillsbury was just one of many psychologists who accepted such notions (e.g., R. M. Yerkes, Psychological Examination in the United States Army \\[1921\\]; W. S. Hunter, General Psychology \\[1919\\]; R. S. Woodworth, Psychology \\[1921\\]).\n\n### 1911 Carl Emil Seashore\n\n-   Seashore, music and eugenics: <http://www.brooklyn.cuny.edu/web/academics/centers/hitchcock/publications/amr/v48-2/devaney.php>\n-   Seashore wrote extensively on eugenics and euthenics\n-   Member of Advisory Council: International commission on eugenics, Eugenics committee of the United States of America\n\n### 1912 Edward Lee Thorndike\n\n-   wrote extensively on eugenics\n    -   @thorndikeHumanNatureSocial1940\n    -   @thorndikeEugenicsSpecialReference1913\n-   Member of Advisory Council: International commission on eugenics, Eugenics committee of the United States of America\n-   \"the human nature club\"\n\n### 1913 Howard Crosby Warren\n\n-   SEP society gives the HC Warren medal every year\n-   Listed as a new active member of Eugenics Research Association in Eugenical News\n\n### 1914 Robert Sessions Woodworth\n\n-   obit appears in the Eugenics Review [@welfordCurrentPsychologicalIssues1961]\n-   see discussion on Woodworth's eugenics at Columbia [@rupertRaceScienceColumbia2019]\n-   Member of Advisory Council: International commission on eugenics, Eugenics committee of the United States of America\n\n### 1915 John Broadus Watson\n\n-   The famous behaviorist\n-   Listed as a eugenics researchers in the Eugenical News\n-   Angell was his advisor\n-   John B.

Psychological Review, 45(5), 354--376. https://doi.org/10.1037/h0055419\n-   Haven't found specific eugenic writing\n\n### 1927 Harry Levi Hollingworth\n\n-   advocates for eugenics in the book \"Vocational Psychology\" @hollingworthVocationalPsychologyIts1916\n\n### 1928 Edwin Garrigues Boring\n\n-   credited with founding the history of psychology discipline\n-   worked with Yerkes doing IQ testing in the military\n-   Eugenics views unclear, seems to not discuss the topic so much when he writes his histories\n\n### 1929 Karl Lashley\n\n-   detailed analysis of Lashley's racism and hereditarianism @weidmanConstructingScientificPsychology1999\n\n### 1930 Herbert Sidney Langfeld\n\n-   writes on eugenics related issues here @langfeldIIHeredityExperience1949, but focuses more on the nature/nuture debate, and seems to take a neutral side on eugenics, which references in terms of \"political\" takes on the issues.\n\n### 1931 Walther Samuel Hunter\n\n-   From wikipedia, this is a perfect description of accidental eugenics, \"Hunter served in the military for sixteen months during World War I. He was the chief psychological examiner in three army camps.\\[2\\] During that time he compiled bar graphs with E.S. Jones that showed the predictive value of group psychological tests.\\[3\\] His work persuaded government officials to continue the testing program, which ultimately led military officials to order the recording of data on the national origins of the troops tested.\\[3\\] The data collected was used in a way that Hunter did not approve; combining the psychological test scores with the location of where the individual grew up supported the notion of Nordic superiority, which was not his intention.\\[3\\]\"\n-   Might be worth reading Hunter's delayed reaction research in animals and children [@hunterDelayedReactionChild1917]. On the hand, it seems that Yerkes advocated that tests of delayed reaction ability could distinguish humans from infra-humans. And, on the other hand, the results were used in the context of debate about mental representations.\n\n### 1932 Walter Richard Miles\n\n-   hired by Terman at Stanford, trained by Carl Seashore, married a psychologist who studied gifted children.\n-   A funny story about not getting to meet Pearson on a lab visit <https://thepsychologist.bps.org.uk/volume-25/edition-8/looking-back-walter-miles-and-his-grand-tour>\n-   wrote a biography of RM Yerkes. Miles, W. R. (1946). Robert Mearns Yerkes. American Psychologist, 1(6), 175--178. This biography leaves out Yerkes' eugenics. Although it show a painting of Yerkes set in front of a tree, which seemse obviously connected to his eugenics.\n-   did a bunch of intelligence testing work\n-   @milesTRAININGPRACTICEMENTAL1935 talks around eugenics issues and human superiority in terms of longevity, calls for more developmental research in the tradition of Cattell's individual difference work.\n\n### 1933 Leon Luis Thurstone\n\n-   famous for his statistical approaches to intelligence testing.\n-   So far haven't read Thurstone closely and haven't found clear indications of his views on eugenics. However, it is interesting to read comments on his work by eugenicists (e.g., @thomsonTRENDNATIONALINTELLIGENCE1946). So, how does Thurstone explain his work knowing that eugenicists are highly interested in it for the purposes of eugenics?\n-   consider Thurstone in the context of racist ideologies of the time @samelsonRacePsychologyStudies1978\n\n### 1934 Joseph Peterson\n\n-   Peterson, J., & Lanier, L. H. (1929). Studies in the comparative abilities of whites and negroes. Mental Measurement Monographs.\n    -   where they conclude whites are superior.\n\n### 1935 Albert Theodore Poffenberger\n\n-   Relation to Thomas Poffenberger? of Poffenberger, T. (1963). Two thousand voluntary vasectomies performed in California: background factors and comments. Marriage and Family Living, 25(4), 469-474.\n\n-   Generally an advocate for appling testing everywhere to make sure everyone goes into their pre-ordained slot in life.\n\n-   Some work on testing and predicting success in life from school grades. Poffenberger, A.T. (1925). School achievement and success in life. Journal of Applied Psychology, 9(1), 22--28.\n\n-   Poffenberger, A. T., & Carpenter, F. L. (1924). Character Traits in School Success. Journal of Experimental Psychology, 7(1), 67--74. This paper is a good example of value-free science. There is an effort to expand testing in schools beyond IQ tests to include other tests measuring traits that also predict performance...e.g., fill in the gaps that IQ misses in terms of variance explained. However, very little is said about what how these tests would be used in society, even though it is clear from the authors own collegial associations that \"better\" tests would certainly be put to use for eugenics purposes.\n\n-   @poffenbergerMeasuresIntelligenceCharacter1922 This paper is basically full on eugenics without using the word. Poffenberger describes how IQ tests can be used to slot people into professions that they are \"suitable\" for given their IQ. It is an argument to keep \"low IQ workers\" in their place as laborers, and given the best jobs to people with high IQ, and to worry about how the economy may collapse if people aren't slotted in based on their IQ.\n\n-   @poffenbergerDevelopmentMenScience1930 carries on in the tradition of Galton & Cattell to ask what factors make men of science great. Maintains a thin veneer with respect to avoiding commentary on eugenics.\n\n-   Highly relevant account of the activities of the national research council 1919-1933 (division of anthropology & Psychology), wherein it obvious just how many activities were eugenic in nature. @poffenbergerVIIIDIVISIONANTHROPOLOGY1933\n\n    -   consider also the previous chairmen of the committee:\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](img/NRC.png){fig-align='center' width=364}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n-   W.V.

Mostly this involves googling their name and eugenics, and pulling the string.\n\nMy main aim in making these connections is to draw attention to the larger pattern of institutional eugenics within the discipline of Psychology. I am less interested about whether or not specific individuals were \"card-carrying\" eugenicists, or really truly held eugenics views in their \"soul\" or not. I think it is enough to establish the pattern and spread of eugenic ideology to consider how eugenics shaped the discipline. For example, I suspect that rampant eugenics had a part to play in systemically limiting the diversity of faculty in Psychology. I suspect it also guided the questions we ask, and continue to ask.\n\nSo, as a part of reflecting on what I am doing, I drew up a quick spreadsheet of the APP presidents. For the first 50, I gave them each a eugenics score from 0 to 1, with some intermediate scores representing eugenics adjacent work. These are just some rough personal qualitative estimates, to put a number on things. My rough numberization adds up to 34.75 of 50 APA presidents were into eugenics or eugenics adjacent research. Very few were ever explicitly anti-eugenics.\n\nConsider a sentence like, \"It is overwhelming the case that the first 50 years of American Psychology as measured by APA presidents research interests and leadership demonstrate that the discpline of psychology was primarily constructed as arm of the national eugenics movement in the USA\". I just wrote that sentence, and I'm starting to think that I'm not exaggerating.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## More APA presidents from 1943\n\n### 1943 John Edward Anderson\n\n-   The modern baby book, similar to Galton.

So far my perspective is that psychology as a discipline has a problem with instutional forms of eugenics and racism. Institutional eugenics is term that could carry broad meaning from literal institutions (e.g., such as the APA), to widely adopted policies in society inspired and propagated by eugenics leaders (e.g., IQ testing).\n\nSome American Institutions to consider in terms of Psychology & Eugenics\n\n-   Individual Psychology departments\n-   APA leadership (See presidents list above)\n-   SEP membership (honorary societies in psychology)\n-   AAAS\n-   Federal government research councils and chairs\n\n## Responses by institutions\n\nHow have institutions with some involvement in eugenics responded to their involvement? I've been wondering about this question the whole time that I've learning about eugenics. With respect to eugenics I'm still in the \"what happened\" phase, and perhaps slowly coming to the \"what happened next\" phase, which could lead into the \"what's going on right now phase\".\n\nIn any case. When I have time I will extract this section and make a post out of it to keep track of info I'm finding. I've discovered the internet archive <https://archive.org> contains an ample amount of historical eugenics literature, so have been collecting some of it. It's also interesting to search for indvidual psychologists in this database because all sorts of old textbooks come up. More recently, I've started coming across government documents, for example the National Research Council has convened multiple panels to assess the impact of certain practices on society, some of these include eugenics related practices.\n\n-   University of Alberta, eugenics project in Philosophy department that led to <http://eugenicsarchive.ca>\n-   I've come across a few department level papers exploring eugenics at Yale, Harvard, need to find them again\n-   NRC council work: Wigdor, A.

As a part of this, I'm documenting the eugenics views held by many psychologists, as well as connections between psychologists and eugenics.\n\nCurrently my research is highly disorganized, provisional, and unfolding across various blog posts. In this post I am interested in possible connections between eugenics and the Psychonomics Society, of which I am a member and fellow. I've been attending Psychonomics since the mid 2000s. Until now, I haven't looked into the history and formation of Psychonomics. So I'll do that with an eye out for eugenics.\n\nBefore jumping in I'll say a few things. First, I'm a 40 year old recently tenured cognitive psychologist at Brooklyn College of CUNY. I've been around the cognition block in Canada and the US. It never occured to me, and I was never taught, that there were extraordinarily deep connections between eugenics and psychology in the US and Canada. For a quick primer on some of the connections one could read @yakushkoEugenicsItsEvolution2019. Although, here one might get the sense that the \"pre-history\" of psychology (e.g., before 1950s) was heavily influenced by eugenics, and that part just went away. I'm not so sure (in general for the discipline).\n\nI've been [slowly tracing eugenics and psychology connections leading up to the cognitive revolution](https://crumplab.github.io/blogposts/7_13_20_PsychEugenics/7_13_20_PsychEugenics.html), and am about to continue forward past the 1950s. So, a good place to start is in my own backyard. In other words, does the Psychonomic Society have any eugenics connections? As a member I'd like to know.\n\n@yakushkoEugenicsItsEvolution2019 had mentioned that 31 APA presidents from 1892 - 1947 were involved in eugenics in explicit ways (wrote on eugenics, members of eugenics societies, etc.). I found this shocking, and have started noting connections between [APA presidents and eugenics](https://crumplab.github.io/blogposts/7_13_20_PsychEugenics/7_13_20_PsychEugenics.html). My assessment so far is that there are more than 31 APA presidents who were deeply into eugenics, and the history certainly goes past 1947.\n\nSome books I have found useful in describing the vast ways that eugenics permeated society and psychology are the following: @kuhlBettermentRaceRise2013 presents an astounding history of the international organization of eugenics movements, including some discussion of the organization of eugenics within the discipline of psychology. If you thought eugenics was just a minor historical detail, this book may change your mind. An important point here is that it is worth determining how eugenicists organize themselves leadership positions within societies and governments (e.g., the APA presidents). These actions by eugenicists created deep structures of eugenics within society that continue to reverberate today.\n\n@yakushkoScientificPollyannaismInquisition2019 presents a critical look at some aspects of scientific psychology, especially those rooted in eugenics and positive psychology. If you want a primer on some atrocities committed by well-known psychologists, this is an eye-opener. It may also challenge some of your notions about the role of psychology as a science in society, at least when it comes to the difference between science and scientism.\n\nLast, @pressEugenicMindProject discusses eugenics in the context of Western Canada (I'm an Alberta boy), where the eugenics policy of forced sterilization was legalized; and he develops a \"standpoint theory\" of eugenics, which attempts to discuss eugenics from a survivor perspective, as well as advocate for modern society to understand hallmarks of eugenic thinking so as to guard against modern versions of eugenics campaigns. Wilson was also the project director for the wonderful website <http://eugenicsarchive.ca>.\n\nI found one story from Wilson very inspiring. It turns out the first chair of the Philosophy/Psychology Department at the University of Alberta was the same man who sat on the eugenics board and authorized forced sterilizations until the law was repealed. That department has an institutional legacy of eugenics. That department formed a sub committe in 1998 to assess its own legacy of eugenics, and then respond in some way for the purposes of restorative justice. I commend them for doing that. More Departments need to do this. More societies need to do this. Does Psychonomics need to do this? I don't know, maybe so...let's see.\n\nA last word on labelling and offending people. As I am about to go into my own academic backyard and start asking whether my own colleagues have a history of espousing racist and eugenics ideology, I'm assuming some feathers may be ruffled. My intention is to be constructive in learning about these issues and eventually portraying them back to the society (if there is anything to reflect on...haven't yet started the research). Certainly, some of the terminology may sound offensive, perjorative, and disparaging. However, labels such as \"white racist-eugenicist-psychologist\" are appopriate for psychologists, who explicitly in their own writing, identify themselves in those terms. For example, white racist-eugenicist-psychologists advocate for the supremacy of the \"Nordic races\" through positive eugenic policies, and advocate for the oppression,segregation and/or elimination of non-white races through negative eugenics policies.\n\nI'm still thinking through how to discuss connections between eugenics and individual psychologists. For example, some psychologists may justify a label of racist-eugenicist because of their explicit self-identification under those terms, wherease, other psychologists may not because of a lack of explicit evidence. Nevertheless, I'll entertain the concept of adjacency in considering connections between eugenics and psychology. For example, many psychologists were trained by white racist eugenicists, or worked on topic areas that are of high interest to eugenicists. These psychologists are adjacent to eugenics in some important ways, and may or may not espouse eugenics ideology. In any case, I guess what I am saying is that I will attempt to use labels in a way that elucidates eugenics connections in psychology, for the purposes of understanding potential structural and systemic issues in our discipline that may be fundamentally related to eugenics.\n\nOne question I have often wondered when I have attended Psychonomics is \"Why is Psychonomics so white?\". Given my newfound interest in eugenics, I am interested in determining whether structural eugenics in Psychology, including in Psychonomics could possibly explain some of the overwhelming lack of diversity.\n\nThe above prelude is a work in progress where I am attempting to explain/discover my motivations for doing this work (e.g., this blog is unstable and under active revision, as you can tell from the typos and awkward sentences).\n\n## History of Psychonomics\n\nI must confess I am a newbie when it comes to the history of Psychology, and specifically the history of its organizational structure in Canada and in the US. I've learned a couple things so far. E. G. Boring (1928 APA president) is often credited with starting the History of Psychology. When I read Boring, I find he doesn't do a good job of contextualizing the history of Psychology in terms of eugenics. I wonder why (I have my suspicions), he certainly worked with and knew a whole bunch of eugenicist psychologists, and it is incredible to believe that he didn't know about the ideologies of his colleagues. Maybe he thought the eugenics part was so obvious it went without saying...or maybe not.\n\nAs I write this I'm aware that I haven't read all of the History of Psych journals, so I don't know whether or how they reconstruct the history of Psychology from the lens of eugenics. Need to read more about this for myself.\n\nThere is a tradition in American Psychology of breaking away from the APA (American Psychological Association). The more I learn about the APA, the more I understand why. Psychonomics broke away from the APA, and before looking at that, I wanted to juxtapose the formation of Psychonomics with the formation of another society, [The Association of Black Psychology](http://www.abpsi.org) who has been publishing the [Journal of Black Psychology](https://journals.sagepub.com/home/jbp) since 1974. The ABPsi broke from the APA and in the last half-century have constructed an entire new field in Psychology that is notable for several reasons, including the pursuit of restorative justice for the actions of white racist and eugenicist psychologists against the Black Community. So, I wonder if Psychonomics broke away from the APA for any related reasons...(edit: not so much).\n\n## Plan for connecting dots\n\nI went to the Psychonomics website <https://www.psychonomic.org/page/about>, and found that I could read four papers on the history of Psychonomics. Cool! Thanks Psychonomics. Let's start with the first paper.\n\nOops, I got interrupted. FYI, I'm going to write this like a detective novel, so it will be contemporaneous with my discoveries, and sometimes tangential. I admit, I already read the first paper, which is why I am going to talk more about it here. At the end of the paper there was some discussion about the word Psychonomics, and around that discussion there was some word usage common among eugenic texts. So, I ended up doing the thing I always do, but should have done from the beginning, and that is, Google \"Psychonomics and eugenics\". I did that and I straightaway I found a paper @clelandWarPeaceRevisited1979 published by the Psychonomic Society:\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](img/war.png){fig-align='center' width=1262}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThis is an indication to me that the society at one point condoned aspects of eugenics, and also that some eugenics directed archaeology of Psychonomics is necessary. (Edit: I recently learned that at this time (1979) members could publish in this venue effectively without scrutiny, so this paper could easily reflect more on the authors than on the society. See the editorial from Morgan in the first issue).\n\n## The founding of Psychonomic Society\n\nOK, back to the first paper on the history of Psychonomics. This one is titled, \"The founding of the Psychonomics society\" [@dewsburyFoundingPsychonomicSociety1995]. Before I go through it, it's worth reminding myself (I used to be a history major) what I learned about \"history\" in undergrad.\n\nThere is opinion and perspective in historical retelling. So I need to wonder, what lens is used here to discuss the beginnings of Psychonomics?\n\nHistorical retellings often use the same kinds of tricks. For example, @pressEugenicMindProject refers to Ebbinghaus' quip that \"psychology has a long past, but only a short history\". Wilson uses this quip to point out a common narrative structure in historical retelling. In histories of psychology as a science we see the \"long\" pointers back to the early Greek philosophers. It is often the case that \"long\" pointing is a way of using juxtaposition to connect some current issue with the significance or value of \"well-accepted\" historical figures. E.g., psychology continues in the supremely wonderful and great tradition of the righteous and true great traditions of the past...That kind of thing.\n\nI'll have an eye out for the \"long\" pointers as I \"read between the lines\" of the \"The founding of Psychonomics\". Let's go.\n\nHere's the first bit of the paper:\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](img/psycho1.png){fig-align='center' width=761}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nTLDR, the Psychonomics origin story begins with a bunch of white dudes at a bar. I can totally relate to that, because that is pretty much what my experience is like when I go to Psychonomics.\n\nWe learn that this meet-up was at an AAAS meeting (American Association for the Advancement of Science). Now, far be it from me to criticize the AAAS. And, I have not looked too closely at this organization yet. Suffice it to say, let me connect the AAAS with an important person in its history, James McKeen Cattell. Cattell is a notable eugenicist, as well he was an APA president, and he founded Psychological Review, and he bought Science and edited it for 50 years. I haven't read this paper yet, but it apparently covers some of the eugenics aspects of AAAS [@farberScientistsRoleEugenics2008].\n\nOK, so some AAAS affiliated Psychologists go to a bar...and two years later Psychonomics was born. Some of those psychologists were \"Clarence Graham of Columbia University, Clifford T. Morgan of Johns Hopkins, S. S. Stevens of Harvard, and William S. Verplanck of Hunter College.\" I start looking at the scholarship of the organizers further down.\n\nSo, after the origin story, the founding of Pscyhonomics is set in context of the tradition of splintering off from APA, which many other groups do for various reasons.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](img/psycho2.png){fig-align='center' width=368}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWe are pulled back to into the living room of G. Stanley Hall in 1892, at the dawn of the APA. I would say that Hall was deeply into eugenics, [for some connections see](https://crumplab.github.io/blogposts/7_13_20_PsychEugenics/7_13_20_PsychEugenics.html#1892_granville_stanley_hall).\n\nI think it is also fair to say that the first presidential address published in the first issue of Psych Review in 1894 by George Trumball Ladd (2nd APA president, also frequent contributor to the Journal of Race Development...) was about establishing the place of psychology in Science. From the very beginning the eugenicists involved in Psychology were very eager to establish and maintain the scientific purity of Psychology. This a theme that sometimes is used to give psychologists cover to conduct \"science\" in a \"value-free\", \"objectively neutral\" way (see @yakushkoScientificPollyannaismInquisition2019 on scientism). FYI, I also think that Ladd was dog-whistling to the eugenicists in the crowd in his final thoughts about using psychology for the betterment of society. It is also highly interesting to inspect the first issue of Psych Review for known eugenicists (e.g., Francis Galton, founder of eugenics, publishes on his ability to arithmetic by smell).\n\nNext, we learn about some previous splits within the APA.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](img/psycho3.png){fig-align='center' width=373}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWould you be surprised if Leta Hollingworth was a racist and eugenicist? See here [wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leta_Stetter_Hollingworth). She was also married to another eugenicist psychologist Harry Levi Hollingworth, who was president of the APA in 1927. You could read Wallin's eugenics here [@wallinHygieneEugenicGeneration1914]. This split didn't last long and the APA recouped the AACP, and established the first \"section\" in the APA. Neato, I didn't know that.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](img/psycho4.png){fig-align='center' width=363}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThere is an acknowledgement of the role that WW II played in the discipline of psychology. There are many connections between psychologists and war efforts in the US, and without going into that history, let me point out a primary theme is eugenics, and many of the psychologists involved were also members of eugenics societies. We see some mention of some other societies, like SEP (Society of Experimental Psychologists)...notably this exclusive honor club of psychologists still gives the Howard Crosby Warren medal every year. HC Warren was another APA president (1913), and he is listed in the Eugenical News as an active researcher. But, the main point of this paragraph is the italicized two words \"and practice\", whereby the new bylaws of the APA included \"practice\" alongside science, as a way into the APA. It seems like the scientists didn't like this very much. They didn't want the science to be watered down. I get that.\n\nWe are then treated to a context of previous attempts to make scientific clubs of psychologists, where psychologists could just finally hang out and be scientists with each other.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](img/p5.png){fig-align='center' width=438}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe experimentalists were notable misogynists, and they grew into the SEP, which maintained its misogynistic roots. I won't go into the membership of SEP, because this about Psychonomics, and SEP is another day.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](img/p6.png){fig-align='center' width=437}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nPart of the point in this history could be to establish the \"long\" roots of Psychonomics by tying it to preceding exclusive honor societies. There is much cross-fertilization between the societies, as noted throughout this paper (and even today).\n\nNext, we learn about earlier efforts by Titchener's group to create scientific space within APA conferences of the 20s.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](img/p7.png){fig-align='center' width=448}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nI haven't found Titchener connect himself with eugenics in his writing, but Boring is certainly eugenics adjacent (having with worked with Yerkes in the army IQ testing effort). Dallenbach and Fernberger I don't know much about. Dallenbach was on an NRC committee with several other known eugenics proponents. Fernberger wrote a biography for HC Warren, wrote on \"the problem of mental disorders\", and seems eugenics adjacent at first glance. J. E. Anderson was APA president in 1943, and wrote \"The Modern baby Book and Child Development Record\", which follows in the footsteps of Galton's eugenics approach. Raymond Dodge was APA president in 1916, did some IQ testing during the war, and supported some eugenics policies, but doesn't appear to be a major public advocate of eugenics. Haven't looked into Robinson, but he writes about the great need to apply science to \"the problem of public intelligence\". Shepard like many his contemporaries worked in testing of the military during the war.\n\nIt seems that this effort of organization didn't really work, and the group fizzled.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](img/p8.png){fig-align='center' width=462}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nBut, it's interesting that very notable people (\"stalwarts\") were in attendance: Harvey Carr, Clark Hull, Joseph Jastrow, H. C. Warren, and Robert S. Woodworth. T. All of these men were deeply into eugenics, and they were also all one-time presidents of the APA [see some notes on each here](https://crumplab.github.io/blogposts/7_13_20_PsychEugenics/7_13_20_PsychEugenics.html).\n\nHuh, next we learn about another fascinating society in Psychology, the psychological round table, or PRT...If you followed my twitter account last summer, you would know that I tweeted a bunch about them. They are a \"well-kept-secret\" honor society that still exists today. They have a smelly history of misogyny. They keep their member list close to their chests. Who knows what their members think about eugenics? It's just one of those questions that has to be asked in a blog post using the lens of eugenics to explore this paper.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](img/p9.png){fig-align='center' width=451}\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](img/p10.png){fig-align='center' width=440}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nI think the TLDR here is that Psychonomics should be proud that among its founders were esteemed members of PRT. Congrats, give yourself a pat on the back.\n\nPRT had GUV as a sister \"secret society\", so ya. Hi GUV friends, wave.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](img/p11.png){fig-align='center' width=445}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAgain we have a list of names of well known psychologists. I'll point to one small puzzle. I know C. W. Eriksen because he invented the flanker task. I've been asking myself, what does that have to do with eugenics? After all, I have used that task on numerous occasions. Well, the puzzle is not about the flanker task. Nope, it is why does C. W. Eriksen appear in a footnote in Kuhl's [@kuhlBettermentRaceRise2013] book on eugenics? It's because Eriksen was among several other psychologists (with eugenics connections) who signed a letter supporting [Arthur Jensen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Jensen), who has often been characterized as a racist psychologist.\n\nfrom Kuhl: \"The ten other scholars were Jack A. Adams, Raymond B. Cattell, Francis H. Crick, C. D. Darlington, Charles W. Eriksen, Eric F. Gardner, Quinn McNemar, Eliot Slater, Robert L. Thorndike, Frederick C. Thorne, and Philip E. Vernon; cf. JBA Oxford, G. 14. The activity was at first coordinated by the psychologist Ellis B. Page of the University of Connecticut; cf. Jensen to Dobzhansky, 9/2/1972, THA Philadelphia: Jensen, Arthur R.\"\n\nAnyway, let's continue with the paper.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](img/p12.png){fig-align='center' width=447}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nInteresting, I did not know that there was a failed attempt to remove division 3 (exp in psych) from APA in 1948. But, I certainly have learned about big names in Experimental Psychology who were eugenicists, like Thorndike, Watson and Lashley. I haven't looked at Spence or Graham. For Spence I will just point out that we worked under Yerkes and Hull, so it seems very likely he was exposed to his mentors' eugenics. It would be interesting to look at Spence's scholarship from the lens of the eugenics ideology of his mentors. (edit: I do that a bit later).\n\nAlright, we have arrived at the beginning of the Psychonomics Society:\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](img/p13.png){fig-align='center' width=453}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nLet's take a look at the table events:\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](img/p14.png){fig-align='center' width=458}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nMore names:\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](img/p15.png){fig-align='center' width=439}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAnd a table of membership of the organizing committee (from the American Men of Science):\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](img/p16.png){fig-align='center' width=440}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nInteresting to note the ages, so many members were all kicked out of PRT and GUV.\n\nMore people get involved. I love how \"diverse\" and \"white males\" was working into the paragraph.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](img/p17.png){fig-align='center' width=443}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThere was some discussion and dissent about the purposes and directions of the new society. I wonder how much of that discussion had to do with restorative justice for survivors of eugenics at that time. I wasn't there, maybe it wasn't on the radar.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](img/p18.png){fig-align='center' width=448}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nSome of the tension in the story appears to be the need to fight for science in psychology, and to make a society that shows everyone why science and psychology is so important. A story like this has been drilled into me over the years. IMO, science shouldn't be an excuse to do psychology.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](img/p19.png){fig-align='center' width=443}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAnd now, we go back to the bar:\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](img/p20.png){fig-align='center' width=446}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nShould I go to Appendix D now, or later...it's choose your own adventure. Let's do it, Appendix D says :\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](img/p21.png){fig-align='center' width=797}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nFor my two cents, the part at the bottom resonates very strongly. It seems there was an elitist contingent from the PRT. Ever wonder why graduate students don't give talks at Psychonomics? Maybe this is why. The elitists won.\n\nBack to the paper. So, 950 invitations were sent out to potential members, the name Psychonomics was adopted and incorporated in 1960. There is an appendix on the name \"Psychonomics\". I'll get to that later.\n\n\"The First Annual Scientific Meeting of the Psychonomic Society The first meeting of the Psychonomic Society was held at the University of Chicago on September 1-3, 1960, just before the 1960 APA meetings. Approximately 294 individuals attended, of whom 195were members, 79 were guests, and approximately 20 were unregistered. The program included 119 papers in 24 sessions arranged in eight time blocks with three concurrent sessions each; four blocks on Thursday, three blocks and an afternoon business meeting on Friday, and one block on Saturday morning. They were grouped into 15 categories. The nature of the experimental psychology ofthe time, at least for the members of the new Psychonomic Society, can be seen in the distribution of papers across sessions; these are presented in Table 3.\"\n\nLet's look at Table 3:\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](img/p22.png){fig-align='center' width=371}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nOh no, it seems that the potpourri session has basically disappeared in terms of modern Psychonomics. Now, should I stay or should I go find the 1960 conference abstracts. I guess I should do that. I'm going to do that now, wish me luck.\n\nNo dice yet, couldn't find the conference abstracts after a quick search. Not sure which archive they are in. In any case, it would be interesting read about the genetics session and a few others.\n\nWell, maybe spoke to soon. I can do things like search \"paper presented to the Psychonomic Society, 2 September 1960\" in Google scholar, and restrict the dates to 1960. Then a few papers that were read at psychonomics in 1960 come up. A start anyway. Here's an example, still would be nice to get the full list at some point.\n\n-   Jerison, H. J. (1961). Quantitative analysis of evolution of the brain in mammals. Science, 133(3457), 1012-1014.\n\nAlright, some stuff happened at the first conference. We learn that it wasn't really too much different than division 3 APA conferences. Then there is the first business meeting, a first newsletter, etc.\n\nSome thorns in the side, or additional reasons why Psychonomics needed to be created, it seems APA was making actual presentations of research more difficult. Kind of funny to imagine Estes' apparatus solution to the problem.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](img/p23.png){fig-align='center' width=439}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIt seems that Psychonomics could be the place where science happened, and still be affiliated with the APA\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](img/p24.png){fig-align='center' width=432}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWhat's in a name...Also, more in the appendix, which I will get to later. Also, some icky quotes in here...what's on page 5 !!!\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](img/p25.png){fig-align='center' width=435}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nSome membership features:\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](img/p26.png){fig-align='center' width=438}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nI guess this part went out the window, said the fellow researching the foundations of the fellow-less society he is a fellow of.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](img/p27.png){fig-align='center' width=436}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThere was a distinct lack of diversity:\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](img/p28.png){fig-align='center' width=432}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nSo this is why Psychonomics is just about coffee...keeps the cost of the conference down though (and I very much appreciate that...Also, I should say I very much appreciate Psychonomics, and the only reason I am spending this much time looking into the history of Psychonomics is because of how much I appreciate this society.)\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](img/p29.png){fig-align='center' width=446}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThen some more stuff about restricting papers and talks to members. LET THE GRADUATE STUDENTS GIVE TALKS ALREADY.\n\nGovernance structure is supposedly lean and in the style of PRT...not sure if that is good or bad. I've never been involved with governance at Psychonomics. Can't say anything about what it's like now.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](img/p30.png){fig-align='center' width=433}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nPsychonomics journals didn't work out right away, but eventually started happening, courtesy of Clifford Morgan.\n\nThe concluding paragraph.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](img/p31.png){fig-align='center' width=432}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nSo a simple history of Psychonomics is that it is a lean organization for scientific psychologists to talk about their science. And it is does that very well.\n\nSocieties have many members and viewpoints and it's unclear what kinds of views Psychonomics members have had over time about issues such as eugenics, or about tolerating or not tolerating other members' views on such issues.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTime for a small break.\n\nAside from eugenics, I wonder how many folks from the governing board of Psychonomics and say all of the journals are also members of PRT and GUV? I would guess quite a few. If so, there is a \"hidden\" layer of elitism to the society, and if you are not part of the club...like moi, then I guess sucks to be you (or me as it happens).\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## Naming Psychonomics\n\nOn the naming of Psychonomics from the appendix:\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](img/p32.png){fig-align='center' width=744}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nI'll point out that James Mark Baldwin also wrote, \"The mental development in the child and race: methods and processes (Baldwin, 1900)\". And, that curiously the word \"flow\" is often used in eugenics literature (see chpt 6 of @yakushkoScientificPollyannaismInquisition2019). These are obviously juxtaposition to eugenics, and I don't know the eugenics literature well enough yet to know if there are additional connections. Anyway, I thought these connections were worth noting.\n\nThe rest of the appendix reads:\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](img/p33.png){fig-align='center' width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nI've had a little bit more time to look at \"Psychonomic\" in the context of eugenics and social darwinism, and I found that it also has a meaning in terms of the \"general psychonomic law\". I found this in a footnote from @goodchildStanleyHallAmerican2012 who discusses G. Stanley Hall (one-time APA president and eugenicist)\n\n\"Cremin, Transformation of the School, 101--2. Cremin described Hall's foundational idea exceptionally well.\"Hall's basic thesis---the 'general psychonomic law,' which he borrowed from Haeckel and Spencer---was that ontogeny, the development of the indi- vidual organism, recapitulates phylogeny, the evolution of the race.\"\n\nI dunno, seems like the general psychonomic law also has a meaning in terms of eugenics writing. Or maybe I'm just reading way too much into this. Here's Hall in his own words...\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](img/p34.png){fig-align='center' width=455}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nYup, psychonomics is a word that also has meaning in eugenics writing. So, there's that.\n\nA final thought on this is the historical tradition of harkening back to something of perceived value. Is it possible that in establishing a new society, the founders chose the word \"Psychonomics\" to harken back to the beginning of the APA, and reference the eugenics writings of the first APA president, G. Stanley Hall? It's a question that falls out of the eugenic analysis lens.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThere are three more papers on the history of Psychonomics on their website, and I'll read those a little bit later. Some of the next steps that I should take include looking more closely at the scholarship of the organizers. Considering the large amount of eugenics oriented research in the APA up to this time, and considering that Psychonomics was mainly planning to be a society that continued APA division 3 research, it would be surprising if the early days of Psychonomics did not include eugenics oriented research.\n\nAt the same time, we are now talking about 1960 and onward, a time in history when it became more unpopular to use the word eugenics (often attributed to widespread public rejection of eugenics following revelations of Nazi war crimes), and to talk openly about promoting eugenics. So, unlike pre 1945 where it was rather easy to line up psychologists who published in psychology and eugenics journals, or otherwise self-identified as being a eugenicist, it seems like more of a challenge to determine whether psychologists in the 60s were involved in eugenics.\n\nBefore I start to look more closely at the scholarship of organizing members, I'd like to mention a few points of interest. For myself, I have been wondering about the connections between eugenics and the cognitive revolution. Psychonomics appears right in the same time frame as the cognitive revolution. I have spent many years thinking about cognition, and basically never thought of myself as contributing in anyway to programs of eugenics. I've been asking basic questions about basic psychological processes. How is that related to eugenics?\n\nIn any case, here are a few tidbits that have started to inform my thinking about the cognitive revolution. First, it is obvious that the history of individual differences psychology is tightly interwoven with eugenics. The development of IQ testing and psychometrics were employed as tools of eugenics many times over in many different venues in society. It was less obvious to me how experimental psychology was involved. One way was that many formative psychologists in experimental psychology were eugenicists, Thorndike, Watson, Lashley, Hull...the list goes on.\n\nAt one point I jumped ahead of myself (in terms of going through the APA presidents), and I looked George A. Miller & eugenics. Most of us know Miller for his magic number 7 + or - 2 paper. That paper was also about applying ideas from Claude Shannon's information theory to information processing limitations in psychology. Well, guess where Claude Shannon did his master's thesis. At the eugenics record office in Cold Springs Harbor (Long Island New York). This is one of those weird eugenics connections.\n\nIt took some googling but eventually I found George Miller explain his version of eugenics in 1967 in @millerPsychologicalPerspectivesYear1967. Miller inverts a common fear of morons that eugenicists usually foment about. Eugenicists like H. Goddard [@goddardWhoMoron1927] exclaim that morons are everywhere, they look like everyone else, but they are morons because of their IQ, and they must be removed from society or else society will collapse. Miller, in his futurism about the year 2000, says the society will become too complex rendering everyone morons, so basically we need to do something about it or else. Miller cryptically talks about when \"the day comes that we have the necessary facts to support a realistic eugenics program, such information could be valuable.\" Miller doesn't say who he wishes to eliminate, he's cryptic. Still, he thanks his buddy R.J. Hernnstein at the beginning, probably for all the chats about eugenics (Hernnstein would later publish \"the Bell curve\").\n\nStill, what did this have to do with cognition? Well, Miller also explains how it obvious that information processing capacity needs to be increased in order for society to survive. It's plain old Intelligence-exalting, fear-mongering, Galtonian eugenics with fancy words. So, there is some ideology between Miller's magic number. And it apparently has to do with eugenics.\n\nSecond, although I still have to confirm this, it appears that Abraham Maslow was deeply into eugenics, but only wrote about it privately, and this was only made generally available to public upon publishing of some of his private notes.\n\nI mention these two examples primarily because it may be difficult to suss out eugenic ideology among psychologists who don't share their views publicly, but continue nevertheless to conduct science that has eugenic implications. So, it's a bit of a warning to myself to not get carried away with wondering if someone is really a eugenicist or not. It's not for me to decide. One of primary aims is to document more clearly the structural eugenics aspects. In other words, I think at some point it will become clear enough that there was a bunch of eugenics going on, and that this shaped our discipline, and if this is true, it is something Psychonomics has to deal with.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## Psychonomics Originators\n\nEugenicists were very good at getting into the APA, especially as APA presidents. They were also very good at sitting as chairmen in US government committees (see the NRC 1919-1933 division of anthropology & Psychology). It would be kind of astounding to me if there was no interest among eugenicists in having a piece of Psychonomics from the very beginning. Let's take a look.\n\nAlso, what follows are personal notes, sometimes interspersed with \"maybe\" eugenic-adjacent things, sometimes things I'm interested in returning to for other reasons. After all, even though I have an interest in learning about psychology from the lens of eugenics, this is likewise an opportunity for me to learn about people I didn't know about before.\n\n### Wendell R.

He deemed a general intelligence test \"the single most important test that can be administered for vocational guidance purposes\" (Humphreys, 1985, p. 211). He also coined the concept \"inadequate learning syndrome\" (ILS) and argued it was a more important social problem than the AIDS epidemic (Humphreys, 1988).\n-   Amid the controversy generated by publication of The Bell Curve in 1994, Humphreys wrote a target article (Humphreys, 1994), which stimulated a series of comments by a number of prominent scholars in the field. He generated further controversy by accepting funding from the Pioneer Fund.

He was the author of the 1943 textbook Physiological Psychology, as well as a co-founder of the Psychonomic Society in 1959, of which he served as the first chairman.\\[2\\]\\[3\\] He also established three academic journals from 1964 to 1966: Psychonomic Science, Psychonomic Monograph Supplements, and Perception & Psychophysics. He went on to give these journals to the Psychonomic Society in 1967.\\[4\\] In his honor, the Society for Behavioral Neuroscience and Comparative Psychology, Division 6 of the American Psychological Association, awards the Clifford T. Morgan Distinguished Service to Div. 6 Award.\\[5\\]\n-   Notable student was John Zubek!\n-   Beach, F. A., Hebb, D. O., Morgan, C. T., & Nissen, H. W. (1960).

Some interesting stories about the publishing side of things. [@dewsburyHistoryPsychonomicSociety1996]\n\n### Psychonomic Science\n\nRunning out of steam a bit. I've perused a bit through the journal [Psychonomic Science](https://link.springer.com/journal/40628/volumes-and-issues), which runs from 1964 to 1972. There are a smattering of papers that are eugenics adjacent IMO, but it mostly seems like fairly standard Psychonomics fare. It's really great most of these papers are open access, I love this about Psychonomics. The journal also publishes some of the abstracts from Psychonomics conferences. I took a quick look at a few of them, and didn't see any more papers with eugenics in the title like this @clelandWarPeaceRevisited1979, which seems like a rarity. Also, the word \"eugenic\" and \"eugenics\" return no results from the journal.\n\n### Psychonomic Monograph Supplements\n\nFor whatever reason I didn't have an easy time searching the table of context of Psychonomic monograph supplements. It seems that Springer does not index this one?\n\n### Bulletin of the Psychonomic Society\n\n1973-1993\n\nInteresting new concept that members are their own editors, so they can publish things and take responsibility for them. I think this means no peer review (see Morgan's editorial in first issue). This is the journal that published the one positive eugenics paper mentioned earlier. One other paper used the word eugenics when they references an article from a eugenics journal.\n\nThere are several papers returned by genetics, lots of intelligence papers, and some race-based papers. There's 20 years of publications, and that's a whole of reading, maybe some other time.\n\nOops, spoke to soon. @grayHereditaryGeniusRevisited1983 is a very real eugenics treat in 1983, straight out of Galton's playbook. Wow. Maybe peer-review is a good idea after all?\n\n### Perception and Psychophysics (now APP)\n\nA search of \"eugenic\" returns no results, and \"eugenics\" returns 5 papers involving references to papers eugenics journals.\n\n### Psychobiology\n\nNeat, I didn't even know this journal existed. It's on the [list of retired journals](https://www.psychonomic.org/page/other_publications).\n\nNo articles are returned when searching 'eugenic' or 'eugenics'. Certainly no shortage of interesting papers.\n\nI searched \"Galton\" and found these two papers that I had never come across before.\n\nBurton, P. G. (1990). A search for explanation of the brain and learning: Elements of the psychonomic interface between psychology and neurophysiology I. A cognitive approach to early learning. Psychobiology, 18(2), 119-161.\n\nBurton, P. G. (1990). A search for explanation of the brain and learning: Elements of the psychonomic interface between psychology and neurophysiology II. Early behavior and its control, the origin of consciousness, and the rise of symbolic thought. Psychobiology, 18(2), 162-194.\n\nThese are pretty interesting cybernetics inspired papers. Neat that \"psychonomic\" is used as a process (see naming Psychonomics section). The author also has patent that seeks to provide an objective measure of individual differences in cognitive processing <https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/fe/d7/5a/421ac1821dd66d/US20080039698A1.pdf>. If I wasn't using a eugenics lens here I would normally say, oh neat, a thoughtful theory and a useful new tool. But, I could also see value in having work like this contextualized with respect to the history of eugenics in psychology and society.\n\n### Psychonomic Bulletin and Review\n\nTwo papers show up in a search for \"eugenics\", that reference papers in eugenics journals. One of them is slightly on the eugenics nose in how it references and uses RA Fishers ideas (not about statistics).\n\nThere is this paper:\n\nRushton, J. P., & Ankney, C. D. (1996). Brain size and cognitive ability: Correlations with age, sex, social class, and race. Psychonomic Bulletin & Review, 3(1), 21-36.\n\n### Memory and Cognition\n\neugenic and eugenics returns no results, see interim question below\n\n### Learning and Behavior\n\n\"eugenics\" comes up in one citation\n\n### Behavior Research Methods\n\n6 papers returned searching \"eugenics\", all occurring in citations, mostly RA Fisher stats stuff.\n\nThis is an interesting paper to pluck out:\n\nDavenport, J. W., Benson, R. W., Hagquist, W. W., Rankin, G. R., & Shelton, S. E. (1972). Computerized animal intelligence testing. Behavior Research Methods & Instrumentation.\n\nI bet Tolman would have loved to have this automated contraption when he attempted to breed rats for maze learning ability.\n\nTolman, E. C. (1924). The Inheritance of Maze-Learning Ability in Rats. Journal of Comparative Psychology, 4(1), 1.\n\n### Cognitive, Affective, & Behavioral Neuroscience\n\nNo results returned searching \"eugenic\" or \"eugenics\"\n\n### Cognitive Research: Principles and Implications\n\nThis is a new journal, and in general I think use-based cognitive research is pretty great, so there is much to like about this journal. I haven't submitted anything here, but I do some work on cognitive technologies, such as with the [semantic librarian project](https://www.semanticlibrarian.com).\n\nThe words \"eugenic\" and \"eugenics\" don't appear yet in this journal. It's a new journal and probably many researchers, like me only a couple weeks ago, aren't thinking about eugenics everyday or at all. I could imagine the story of eugenics in psychology as it relates to \"use-based\" practices of \"psychological research\" being relevant to guiding modern discussion of applied cognitive research.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nInterim question: Why doesn't the word eugenics appear more often in Psychonomics journals?\n\nI'm not wondering about the absence of papers that explicitly advocate in favor of eugenics (it is still pretty wierd that there are papers like this in the Psychonomic record). I'm wondering about the distinct lack of discussion and contextualization of reseach in terms of eugenics. For example, there doesn't appear to be a paper that examines historical and contemporary research aims and methods in Psychonomics from the lens of eugenics. Maybe, I'm just motivating myself to fill a gap in the literature.\n\nFor example, there are numerous papers about \"intelligence\". And, even though that area has extensive connections to eugenics, and remains a controversial area, it doesn't appear that these issues are discussed directly in papers that use the word intelligence. (I'm inferring this by the fact that searching \"intelligence AND eugenics\" returns zero results).\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## Random stuff\n\nI would never recommend reading the journal \"Mankind Quarterly\". However, it is interesting to read one author's perspective on the founding of Psychonomics, in the paper title \"Raymond B Cattell and the Fourth Inquisition\", by W Glade. Basically, Cattell is a racist and the APA declines to give him an award even though he showed up to receive it. Anyway, it's a head spinning dose of WTF. Nevertheless, the claim is that Psychonomics scientists were tired of this kind of \"leftist\" crap, and left APA because it was getting too \"political\".\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](img/ManQ.png){fig-align='center' width=898}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThis article from Rushton (a notable racist) suggest that the Pioneer Fund (notorious funder of racist science) has funded a past Psychonomics president (chair I assume). - <https://philipperushton.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/The-Pioneer-Fund-and-the-Scientific-Study-of-Human-Differences-2002-by-John-Philippe-Rushton.pdf>\n\n-   These pieces are not about psychonomics, but I came across them in current efforts so am placing them here. They are reviews by R Held and GA Miller.\n\n    1.  Reviewed Work(s): Group Processes: Transactions of the First Conference by Bertram Schaffner Review by: Richard Held, The American Journal of Psychology, Vol. 69, No. 4 (Dec., 1956), pp. 690-692\n    2.  Reviewed Work(s): Cybernetics: Circular Causal and Feedback Mechanisms in Biological and Social Systems, Transactions of the Eighth Conference by Heinz von Foerster, Margaret Mead and Hans Lukas Teuber, Review by: George A. Miller, The American Journal of Psychology, Vol. 66, No. 4 (Oct., 1953), pp. 661-663\n\nWhat is interesting about these reviews is that both authors illustrate how to talk elliptically or cryptically about ideas that loom over the discipline. Both reviews are about conference books/proceedings, and both authors use subtext and allusion to reference ideologies that appear to loom large at the conferences. Could be fun to read the book review sections of AJP! More broadly, this time period is very different from the earlier decades in terms of open discussion of the subtext. For example, in decades prior some eugenicists published their views in eugenics journals and their methods in psychology journals. That kind of parallelism of ideology and method isn't very common anymore, making dot connection more difficult.\n\n## Related Socities\n\n### SEP (Society of Experimental Psychologists)\n\n<http://www.sepsych.org>\n\nSEP is a long-standing honorary society in Psychology. Many towering figures in Psychology are members. I confess to not knowing very much about the society beyond some of the people on the member list. I don't know how that society reflects upon its associations with eugenics that exist via its own membership. Eugenics was certainly widespread and socially acceptable from 1904 onward for many decades, and many Psychologists were committed to eugenics movements. Some of these psychologists were members of SEP.\n\nI'll look at the early members from a paper by E Boring, shared from the SEP website. This is the 1904-1938 time period. The members in order of being elected to the society were:\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](img/SEP.png){fig-align='center' width=419}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIt's interesting to cross-reference this list of members with lists of memberships from Eugenics societies, lists from eugenical news, and other potentially revealing sources like who C Davenport corresponded with. E.g., here are a couple:\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](eugenicmemberlists/AES2.png){fig-align='center' width=485}\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](eugenicmemberlists/EugenicsCommittee.png){fig-align='center' width=425}\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](eugenicmemberlists/EugenicalNews.png){fig-align='center' width=396}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nCorrespondence from C Davenport (director of Eugenics Record Office out of Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory)\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](eugenicmemberlists/DavenportCorrespondence.png){fig-align='center' width=442}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nHuman betterment foundation list\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](eugenicmemberlists/HB.png){fig-align='center' width=538}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nOk, let's do some cross-referencing...I don't have a very good system for this. These kinds of lists have some overlap, but not too much. There's a handful of SEP members (e.g., Seashore, Dunlap, Woodworth, Yerkes, Poffenberger) that appear on these lists. I've started with an excel spreadsheet, but I'm not happy with that method. There are other connections besides membership affiliations. I need to do some thinking about a database approach...\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## Database thoughts\n\nConsider the problem of assessing possible associations between eugenics and members of a psychology society. So far I've been taking a rough collection approach going through the APA presidents, organizers of Psychonomcis, and now looking at SEP. The approach has been to state a name, and then copy some notes about factoids and references that might be relevant in terms of eugenics connections. Once in a while there are some explicit signs, such as being a member of eugenics society.\n\nI'd like some way of assessing these connections more programmatically, such that I apply some kind of similar standard to everyone in terms assessing eugenics associations. Maybe things are just more complicated than this, and every person has their own unique story (of course, this is true too).\n\nI need to reflect on what I'm actually trying to accomplish in this research. It started off as an interesting subject matter that I felt compelled to learn more about. An early thought was that I might be better able to understand aspects of institutional racism in Psychology. For example, if it was true that there was widespread eugenics within Psychology for a long time, especially in the organizations and leadership of Psychology organizations, then perhaps this legacy is responsible for aspects of today's psychology. And, identifying and describing these insititutional features could then hopefully lead to some deconstruction and reconstruction.\n\nI am still mainly interested in characterizing the institutional aspects of eugenics in psychology, as well as how our modern institutions have reacted to the history. I am not that interested in what specific people \"really\" thought about issues of the day. For many, I'm sure that eugenics was rationalized as a great morally progressive project for society. Probably also some people changed their minds on committments to various ideologies over time.\n\nMy view is that eugenics campaigns were waged on people in society in numerous ways. There are many differnent kinds of eugenics survivors. Psychologists were active and complicit in many ways in eugenics campaigns. This side of psychology should be acknowledged more often.\n\nAnyway, I've lost the thread, I'm supposed to be thinking about databases. What kind of database would I want to have?\n\nLet's go back to the list of SEP members. What kind of database could be useful to ask questions about eugenics activities and each member?\n\nNarrative descriptions. One way to go is to do a biography of each person, entertain the lens of eugenics, and then make some judgment calls, and say a few words in summary about the level or nature of their eugenics activities. This is probably the best to way to portray the nuance of the issues for each person. This would take some time.\n\nSadly, I have no training in qualitative research, and I'm a hack historian.\n\nHowever, I have been eyeing something for a while, maybe it could be useful here. I have been developing \"semantic\" search engines for text corpora using cognitive models of semantics (corpus-based distributional models like BEAGLE). Several examples are available here, including the abstracts from the last Psychonomics conference <https://www.semanticlibrarian.com>.\n\nI've been meaning to take the semantic librarian project into the domain of digital humanities. For example, could a tool for document similarity analysis based on cognitive models be useful in the context of historical research? Maybe a semantic librarian could be helpful here.\n\nTBH, I've been anticipating a day like today for a while. For example, I've been trying to make semantic librarian's easier to use by sharing R code necessary to create your own <https://crumplab.github.io/RsemanticLibrarian/>. Most of the semantic librarians I've built are for abstracts, so they are structured in a particular way that supports searching by author and year etc. However, there is a much more general notion to the semantic librarian, which is a kind of semantic mixed-methods database. The minimal example is here <https://crumplab.github.io/RsemanticLibrarian/articles/Alice.html>. Actually, the best example a wine \"Sommeantic Librarian\" that I made with a mixed database (basically wine reviews coded by several factors) <https://crumplab.shinyapps.io/somme/>.\n\nSo, partly I guess I'm sayng I should use this stuff here somehow. The semantic librarian approach will take a while. And, sure I could create semantic vector for eugenics and then compare similarity to names and authors in the database. That would be interesting I suspect, but it would be difficulty to know what the similarity scores actually represent. Still, something worth doing I think.\n\nAside from that, I could try some related methods.\n\nI'm imagining each person as a JSON object, where each person can have properties.\n\n-   Person = Name\n    -   eugenics = total score?\n    -   Properties\n        -   eugenics membership: TRUE/FALSE\n        -   eugenics in private correpsondence: TRUE/FALSE\n\nSomething like the above, where it could be expandable as I learn that I need to add different kinds of attributes, and then I could develop some way of assessing the \"data\" for each person, potentially assigning a eugencis score.\n\nAt the end of the day it would be nice to figure out these kinds of flavors about individuals\n\n-   pro and active in eugenics\n-   anti-eugenics\n-   not involved or associated in eugenics\n-   accidental eugenics\n-   eugenics adjacent\n-   functional contributions in the service of eugenics\n\nI guess I'm most interested in assessing a society or organization for its functional contributions to eugenics, as a way of determining the amount and quality of instutional/systemic eugenics for an organization. So, obviously I need to take heed of SS Stevens, and do a better job of operationalizing these things.\n\n## note collection\n\nAt some point I'll need to think about a scale for eugenics and individual psychologists. I'm not sure how this would work, it could be a point system, or a table of qualitative units. I'll use this space to think about eugenics and eugenics adjacent features that seem relevant.\n\nExplicit features\n\n-   member/researcher/leader of a eugenics society. E.g., self identified in the Eugenical News, or other Eugenics Society membership lists.\n-   advocates for eugenics in print either in academic work, or in other work\n\nAdjacent Features\n\n-   publishes in a eugenics journal\n-   worked/trained by a known eugenicist\n-   worked in institutions that were heavily influenced by eugenics, such as Yale's IHR\n-   Signatory of letters supporting eugenicists/race science\n-   intelligence testing\n-   selection procedures (of people)\n-   heredity/twin studies\n\nEugenics Adjacent research\n\nIt's clear that eugenics adjacent research exists, but much of it may be unlikely to be identified as such. That's fine. In using eugenics as a historical lens, it could be enough that this lens is useful for capturing aspects of Psychonomic research in a new light.\n\nFor example, I would argue base on G. A. Miller's own words, that his research into information processing capacity limitations was eugenics adjacent research. Rather than IQ, Miller used bits and chunks to characterize bandwidths of information processing capacity, and he clearly saw this as important in the context of eugenics.\n\nA larger issue looms for basic cognitive research. If one is studying a basic cognitive process, and one thinks about this process as having qualities of function that are good vs bad, or efficient vs inefficient, or desirable vs undesirable, and one intends to clarify how the process works for the purposes of identifying the quality of that process among individuals in a population, and then does this for the purpose of positive or negative eugenics...well, that would be eugenics wouldn't it. From my perspective, cognition should take an anti-eugenics stand, and commit to work and perspectives on the work that actively guard against eugenics.\n\n## References\n",
