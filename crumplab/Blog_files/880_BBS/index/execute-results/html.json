I first landed at Fosstodon, and then made an account on mastodon.social, which became very slow due to server load. After digging around a bit and learning new words like #fediverse and activitypub, I decided to spin up my own instance of mastodon using [masto.host](http://masto.host/). So, now you can find me [https://bbs.crumplab.com/\\@MattCrump](https://bbs.crumplab.com/@MattCrump){.uri}, or `@MattCrump@bbs.crumplab.com`.\n\nI'm not totally sure why I put myself into my own mastodon instance, but I'll talk reasons later on. For now, this is an excuse to learn new web stuff while benefiting from a rich social network. Without further ado.\n\n## Setting up a mastodon instance on masto.host\n\nI saw Jon Henshaw post about running his own mastodon instance on [masto.host](http://masto.host/), and that seemed interesting, so I tried it:\n\n<https://twitter.com/henshaw/status/1587072753034842118>\n\nHere's what happened.\n\n1.  Went to [masto.host](http://masto.host/).\n\n![](images/Screen%20Shot%202022-11-01%20at%207.50.57%20AM.png)\n\n2.  I chose the moon plan because it's just gonna be. But, I noted that it is possible to upgrade and downgrade, so if I wanted to invite more people to my little bbs experiment I could do that. Or, if you are setting this up for a group, it seems pretty easy to grow larger (at least up to 2000 users for 89/month).\n\n![](images/Screen%20Shot%202022-11-01%20at%207.53.04%20AM.png)\n\n3.  \n",
