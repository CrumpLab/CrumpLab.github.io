## The dynamics of best laid action plans: Tracing response scheduling in skilled typing.

2016, Behmer, L. P. & Crump, M. J. C., Eastern Psychological Association, New York, NY.

Abstract: This talk presents evidence for predictions made by computational models about parallel and serial activation of action sequences during skilled motor performance. While employing a go-signal procedure that forced typists to occasionally stop and type a previous or future letter, we observed that future responses displayed graded activation states consistent with parallel models of activation. These findings support competitive queuing models employing a winner-take-all mechanism for selecting the most active element over other inhibited elements.

## Contextual control over stimulus-response sets.

2016, Brosowsky, N. P. & Crump, M. J. C., Eastern Psychological Association, New York, NY.

Abstract: Context has been shown to cue the automatic reinstatement of various psychological processes across domains. The current study investigates context-dependency in a previously unexamined aspect of cognitive control: the creation and execution of stimulus-response sets. Specifically, we investigate whether response subsets can become associated with, and retrieved by contextual cues. Over three choice reaction time experiments we found no evidence for contextual control over stimulus-response sets.
