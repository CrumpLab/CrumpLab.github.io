## Try not to think about what you?re doing: Event-related desynchronization (ERD) in the SMA and event-related synchronization (ERS) in the frontal lobe reveals a dissociation of hierarchically controlled outer and inner loop processes during typing.

Abstract: Attention to the details of actions disrupts performance. For example, forcing people to type letters of a word assigned to one hand compared to all letters leads to slower RTs (Logan & Crump, 2009). Given that people are generally fast at normal typing, this suggests that there may be a two-loop control system for skilled actions in which an outer loop is involved in planning, and an inner loop executes kinematic actions, independent of outer loop oversight. Previous EEG studies have focused only on measuring parallel response ordering by the inner loop during normal typing (Logan, Miller, & Strayer, 2011; Pinet et al., 2015). Here, we present behavioral and EEG evidence dissociating outer and inner loop processes. Participants typed four letter words under conditions that varied whether the outer loop closely monitored the details of action execution. Explicit monitoring required that participants type only the letters exclusively assigned to the left or right hand. Normal typing required considerably less monitoring; participants typed all of the letters of the word with both hands. RTs were significantly faster for normal versus monitored typing. Also, alpha-ERD in bilateral clusters of the SMA at about 500 ms prior to the first keystroke was significantly greater during normal versus monitored typing. Finally, during the typing interval, alpha-ERS in the frontal cluster was greater during monitored typing. This suggests outer loop monitoring of the output of the inner loop leads to deficits in performance and an increase in premotor and higher cognitive processing.

## The dynamics of best laid action plans: Tracing response scheduling in skilled typing.

Abstract: This talk presents evidence for predictions made by computational models about parallel and serial activation of action sequences during skilled motor performance. While employing a go-signal procedure that forced typists to occasionally stop and type a previous or future letter, we observed that future responses displayed graded activation states consistent with parallel models of activation. These findings support competitive queuing models employing a winner-take-all mechanism for selecting the most active element over other inhibited elements.

Abstract: Context has been shown to cue the automatic reinstatement of various psychological processes across domains. The current study investigates context-dependency in a previously unexamined aspect of cognitive control: the creation and execution of stimulus-response sets. Specifically, we investigate whether response subsets can become associated with, and retrieved by contextual cues. Over three choice reaction time experiments we found no evidence for contextual control over stimulus-response sets.
