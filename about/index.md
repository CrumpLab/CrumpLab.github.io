How do people learn new skills like playing a musical instrument or typing on a computer keyboard? How does memory work? How do people pay attention to their surroundings? How do people become sensitive to patterns and regularities in their environment?

The Human Cognition and Performance lab investigates these kinds of questions using a variety of methods to test theoretical and computational models of human cognition. Research associates in the lab are trained in a variety of methods, with a strong focus on computer programming skills for creating experiments and analyzing data. These include programming techniques for creating behavioral experiments from scratch, coding dynamic multi-trial experiments online and conducting them on Amazon's Mechanical Turk, coding for batch data-analysis and for expressing cognitive theories in the form of computational models.

## Location

The lab is located in the Department of Psychology at Brooklyn College of CUNY, and affiliated with the Cognition, Language, and Development training area of the Psychology Doctoral program at the Graduate Center of CUNY.
