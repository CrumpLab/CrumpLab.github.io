Thanks to the CUNY OER initiative I received some funds to develop [an open-educational resource for teaching introductory cognitive psychology](https://www.crumplab.com/cognition). I got started in summer 2021, and have been adding bits and pieces ever since.

## What's done so far

There are lots of components to talk about, and I want to use this post to reflect on content development, rather than structure and tool development.

If you are unfamiliar with the suite, here's a quick run down.

1.  Main website is here <https://www.crumplab.com/cognition>
2.  Textbook is here <https://www.crumplab.com/cognition/textbook>
3.  The website has learning modules for each week of the course. The learning modules contain textbook readings, slide decks, and optional assignments
4.  During Spring 2022, I made a whole bunch of mini-lectures that go with the slide decks and [posted them on youtube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDtczbtj66Q4y_usx7_vkHfiHkKDKl5uG). This is all part of the learning modules
5.  I have a test bank too

All of the source code for compiling these resources is shared in this github repository <https://github.com/CrumpLab/cognition>. I'm still working on developing a user guide, but see <https://crumplab.com/cognition/articles/oer/oer.html>.

## What's next: Chapters and Experiments

The textbook only goes to chapter 9. Ideally, any decent textbook would go to 11.

These are chapters I had plans to write, but didn't finish yet.

-   Implicit Cognition
-   Computational modeling
-   Categorization
-   Attention and Working Memory
-   Language and Semantic Cognition
-   Judgment and Decision Making
-   Thinking

It would also be good to include a chapter on perception, and perhaps another on emotion. I got burned out a bit writing the first 9 chapters over two months in summer 2021...still haven't attempted to write another chapter since then. But that's OK, it's given me a bit of time to reflect on what I did, and what to do next.

I also have plans to embed working experiment demos into each chapter and/or learning module. Making experiment demos is higher on the priority list than writing new chapters for this coming summer, but we'll see if I can't turn out at least one or two.

## Vision for the textbook

I considered involving a few colleagues to help with writing textbook chapters at the very beginning. And, thanks to all those who volunteered and talked with me about this project back then. Ultimately, I didn't have enough cash to make it worth the effort, it was still a pandemic, and I didn't have the bandwidth to coordinate anything. So, I thought I would take a swing.

The vision of the book is in the title "Instances of Cognition: Questions, Methods, Findings, Explanations, Applications, and Implications". Looking at what is actually in the book, I think the title remains a promissory note. For example, I wanted to integrate instance theories of cognition throughout the book, but so far that didn't happen. Nevertheless, that part does convey a more general theme that I do develop about the plethora of perspectives and approaches there are in cognition.

Before I wrote the textbook I was feeling irony towards myself. I don't normally like textbooks, and I don't usually teach cognition with a textbook. I usually develop course packs around primary journal articles, and assign those as readings. Now that I have some textbook chapters, I can assign those as readings too.

### Opinion and modules

I thought it would be useful for the textbook to have a point-of-view that helped tie chapters together and resonate with recurring themes. I have my own opinions about the story of cognitive psychology, so I was hoping that this would provide recurring themes to tie chapters together. In hindsight, I need to develop these themes more explicitly, and then make sure they provide the glue I am looking for in the chapters.
