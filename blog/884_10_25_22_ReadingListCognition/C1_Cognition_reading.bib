  abstract = {Presents an experimental study of the large variety of processes which people call "thinking." The book contains comparatively few specific references to the work of other psychologists about thinking. In writing it, in fact, the author was not concerned to produce anything like a systematic treatise. The author had three principal aims in mind. First to try to put thinking into its place as a natural development from earlier established forms of bodily skilled behaviour. Secondly, on the basis of this approach, to design some more or less novel experiments of a predominantly objective type, and such that anybody with sufficient interest could carry further for himself. Thirdly, to illustrate a few of these experiments, and to embark upon some discussion of their results. The book is organized into the following sections: Thinking as a Form of Skill; Thinking Within Closed Systems--Interpolation; Thinking Within Closed Systems--Extrapolation; Thinking Within Closed Systems--Evidence in Disguise; Theoretical; Adventurous Thinking--Two Transitional Experiments; Adventurous Thinking--The Thinking of the Experimental Scientist; Adventurous Thinking--First Hand about Experimental Thinking; Adventurous Thinking--Everyday Thinking; and Adventurous Thinking--The Artist's Thinking.

  abstract = {From citation rates for over 85,000 articles published between 1950 and 2004 in 56 psychology journals, we identified a total of 500 behavioral cognitive psychology articles that ranked in the top 0.6~\% in each half-decade, in terms of their mean citations per year using the Web of Science. Thirty nine of these articles were produced by 78 authors who authored three or more of them, and more than half were published by only five journals. The mean number of cites per year and the total number of citations necessary for an article to achieve various percentile rankings are reported for each journal. The mean number of citations necessary for an article published within each half-decade to rank at any given percentile has steadily increased from 1950 to 2004. Of the articles that we surveyed, 11~\% had zero total citations, and 35~\% received fewer than four total citations. Citations for post-1994 articles ranking in the 50th–75th and 90th–95th percentiles have generally continued to grow across each of their 3-year postpublication bins. For pre-1995 articles ranking in the 50th–75th and 90th–95th percentiles, citations peaked in the 4- to 6- or 7- to 9-year postpublication bins and decreased linearly thereafter, until asymptoting. In contrast, for the top-500 articles, (a) for pre-1980 articles, citations grew and peaked 10–18-year postpublication bins, and after a slight decrease began to linearly increase again; (b) for post-1979 articles, citations have continually increased across years in a nearly linear fashion. We also report changes in topics covered by the top-cited articles over the decades.},

  abstract = {The dominant view in cognitive psychology is that memory includes several distinct and separate systems including episodic memory, semantic memory and associative learning, each with a different set of representations, explanatory principles and mechanisms. In opposition to that trend, there is a renewed effort to reconcile those distinctions in favour of a cohesive and integrative account of memory. According to instance theory, humans store individual experiences in episodic memory and general-level and semantic knowledge such as categories, word meanings and associations emerge during retrieval. In this Perspective, we review applications of instance theory from the domains of remembering, language and associative learning. We conclude that instance theory is a productive candidate for a general theory of cognition and we propose avenues for future work that extends instance theory into the domain of cognitive computing, builds hybrid instance models and builds bridges to cognitive neuroscience.},
