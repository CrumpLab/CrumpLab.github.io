This is going to be a very quick post with pointers on the [jatos](https://www.jatos.org) setup I use to serve [jspsych](https://www.jspsych.org/7.3/) experiments to the web.

It is possible to use jatos through <https://mindprobe.eu>, but I have never tried that.

Instead, I run my own jatos server on a digital ocean droplet following these instructions from the jatos documentation:

- <https://www.jatos.org/JATOS-on-DigitalOcean.html>

I didn't have that much experience with digital ocean, but the tutorial was enough to get things working for me. 

Anyway let's get into it.

# Testing on a local copy of Jatos

1. Start here with the getting started in 4 steps to install a local copy of jatos.
