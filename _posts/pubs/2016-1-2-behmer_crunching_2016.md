abstract: "People have the extraordinary ability to control the order of their actions. How people do the sequencing, and become skilled at sequencing with practice, is a long-standing problem (Lashley, 1951). Big data techniques can shed new light on these questions. We used the online crowd- sourcing service, Amazon Mechanical Turk, to measure typing performance from hundreds of typists who naturally varied in skill level. The large data set allowed us to test competing predictions about the acquisition of serial-ordering ability that we derived from computational models of learning and memory. These models suggest that the time to execute actions in sequences will correlate with the statistical structure of actions in the sequence, and that the pattern of correlation changes in particular ways with practice. We used a second big data technique, n-gram analysis of large corpuses of English text, to estimate the statistical structure of letter sequences that our typists performed. We show the timing of keystrokes correlates with sequential structure (letter, bigram, and trigram frequencies) in English texts, and examine how this sensitivity changes as a function of expertise. The findings hold new insights for theories of serial-ordering processes, and how serial-ordering abilities emerge with practice."
