abstract: "The Stroop effect has been shown to depend on the relative proportion of congruent and incongru- ent trials. This effect is commonly attributed to experiment-wide word-reading strategies that change as a function of proportion congruent. Recently, Jacoby, Lindsay, and Hessels (2003) reported an item- specific proportion congruent effect that cannot be due to these strategies and instead may reflect rapid, stimulus driven control over word-reading processes. However, an item-specific proportion congruent effect may also reflect learned associations between color word identities and responses. In two experiments, we demonstrate a context-specific proportion congruent effect that cannot be explained by such word–response associations. Our results suggest that processes other than learning of word–response associations can produce contextual control over Stroop interference."
