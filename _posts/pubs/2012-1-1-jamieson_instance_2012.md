abstract: "We present and test an instance model of associative learning. The model, Minerva-AL, treats associative learning as cued recall. Memory preserves the events of individual trials in separate traces. A probe presented to memory contacts all traces in parallel and retrieves a weighted sum of the traces, a structure called the echo. Learning of a cue–outcome relationship is measured by the cue’s ability to retrieve a target outcome. The theory predicts a number of associative learning phenomena, including acquisition, extinction, reacquisition, conditioned inhibition, external inhibition, latent inhibition, discrimination, generalization, blocking, overshadowing, overexpectation, superconditioning, re- covery from blocking, recovery from overshadowing, recovery from overexpectation, backward blocking, back- ward conditioned inhibition, and second-order retrospec- tive revaluation. We argue that associative learning is consistent with an instance-based approach to learning and memory."
