abstract: "The authors previously described a procedure that permits rapid, multiple within-participant assessments of the contingency between a cue and an outcome (the “streamed-trial” procedure, Crump, Hannah, Allan, & Hord, 2007). In the present experiments, the authors modified this procedure to investigate cue-interaction effects, replicating conventional findings in both the one- and two-phase blocking paradigms. The authors show that the streamed-trial procedure is not restricted to the geometric forms used as cues and outcomes by Crump et al., and that it can incorporate the conventional allergy stimuli, where food is the cue and an allergic reaction is the outcome. The authors discuss the value of the streamed-trial procedure as a method for advancing our theoretical understanding of cue-interaction effects."
