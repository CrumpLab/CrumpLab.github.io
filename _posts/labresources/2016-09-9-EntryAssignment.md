If you’re interested in becoming part of the lab (volunteering, taking a course etc.), the first thing to do is to complete this entry assignment. The assignment consists of writing a small computer program.

A lot of the activities in the lab involve computer programming: during experiments, the timing, stimulus presentation and key press registration are all controlled by programs we write ourselves. When we analyze the data from the experiments, we again do this in programs, written by us, which take the raw data, calculate things such as averages, display results in graphs, and perform statistical tests.

This assignment allows you to demonstrate your interest in this type of activity, and by investing some time in this assignment you can show your commitment to becoming part of the lab.

This page gives the instructions for completing the assignment. The files have been produced by various members of the lab, and each of them (with a few exceptions) contains a specific program. We keep all of the programs written by students who entered the lab before you, and your assignment is to write your own program so that we can add your file as well.

Here are your instructions.
