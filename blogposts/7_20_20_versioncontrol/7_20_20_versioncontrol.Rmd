What's so great about this post is that I get to rewrite it over and over again, and I'm not sure I can make my point unless I do that.

Also, who knows, maybe I could do it in one shot and be done with what I'm trying to say. But, where's the discovery in that?

I seem to have settled in on a blogging process for myself. It occurs to me wax about it for a little bit.

The process can be seen by looking at some of my recent posts around eugenics in psychology. These posts are examples of my learning process. Basically, I'm learning about something, and I am using my blog as a public notebook for myself. Perhaps there is a performative function to this, but to speak for myself, I am hoping there is some value in sharing my notes. Maybe other people will find my version of a learning process useful for them somehow. I don't see the harm in sharing, especially given that I am sharing from a position of priviledge (e.g., recently tenured). And, if people don't like what I'm sharing, just don't read this.
