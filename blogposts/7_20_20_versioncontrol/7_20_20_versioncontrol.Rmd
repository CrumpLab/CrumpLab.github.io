What's so great about this post is that I get to rewrite it over and over again, and I'm not sure I can make my point unless I do that.

Also, who knows, maybe I could do it in one shot and be done with what I'm trying to say. But, where's the discovery in that? (edit: I already didn't do that, and I'm scared to delete this line).

I have recently settled in on a blogging process for myself, and here I talk about that process a bit.

The process is evident in my recent posts about eugenics and psychology. I'm using these posts as my learning process. My blog is notebook in public. Perhaps there is a performative function to this, but to speak for myself, I am hoping there is some value in sharing my notes. 

More to the point of this post, I'm writing this blog in a text editor (R-studio), and I'm posting the content as a website (using R markdown) hosted on a github repository that I use for my lab website, here: <https://github.com/CrumpLab/CrumpLab.github.io>. All of the blog posts on the website are contained in the `blogposts` folder. Because I am using github version control, every edit and change I have committed are all stored in the repository. That makes this a version controlled blog in public with a fairly complete record of all of the words I wrote and deleted and kept etc. 

It's not a perfect record of every entry and deletion. I have to make a choice to preserve the record at any moment. So, I could write and delete a bunch of things before making a commit, and those changes are lost. Oh well. I try to do my best. Most of the time I spray these text files with words, and then make a commit after an hour or two. More recently, I'm trying to make commits that reflect sections of content in my writing. I assume that could be useful later on if I ever want to take a look at "my process". But, I haven't spent too much time doing that. Even this foray into a meta-level discourse on my own blog is relatively new to me. I should probably be researching eugenics right now. Instead, what is this that I'm doing?

I'll be brief and wrap this up...partly recognizing that what I hope this post will be, will undergo many changes, so today what I say is less important than me figuring out eventually what I'm discovering about what I'm saying.

I came across an eye-catching sub-heading in a book by Robert Wilson, called "The eugenic mind". That sub-heading was: "The politics of epistemic apartheid". It's one of those phrases that would normally pass me by because either I'm too dense, or it's too dense, or a combination of both. Wilson develops a standpoint theory of eugenics, which partly has to do with arguing that survivors of eugenics, people on the margins of society with lived experience as targets of eugenics polices, have important knowledge and perspective to bring to the table. Hard to disagree.

I gather there are considerations about knowledge within social science discourse, especially concerning the question of who can know what. This is an important question when lived experience provides unique sources of knowledge, because it becomes fairly obvious that there are impossibilities of knowledge. Somethings can't be known. Additionally, arguments about knowledge could revolve around who can know what given the existence of knowledge gaps. I think this is partly what Wilson describes when he refers to the politics of epistemic apartheid.

I suppose I was reflecting on these concepts, and this prompted the present mass of disorganized words. I don't have answers to who gets to claim knowledge. I am in engaging in a process of creating and refining my own understanding, through writing. I'm doing it in public. I'm doing it with version control. I am attempting to break down epistemic apartheid for myself to the extent possible. I'm looking for epistemic access.

The whole thing is a process. So, I think that a version-controlled blog post is a nice example. This post will change wheneve I edit it. Right now it is a rough scattershot of some vague point I thought was worth aiming at. Maybe I'll delete the whole thing because of some perspective I'll adopt later on. Maybe, I'll keep changing it, like an art experiment. Maybe it will stay here like this forever, threatening to not have a long history of changes preserved in version control. Only time will tell.

I didn't have time to read for typos.

End thought. Nobody wants to read the version control history of a blog. Maybe except wikipedia editors who spend time doing that. Nevertheless, there is something about the layers of version control that symbolizes the process of epistemic discovery and change that is lost in a final "perfect" draft. This is not an argument in support of foisting sloppy word messes upon unsuspecting readers.
