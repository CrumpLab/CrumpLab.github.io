I'm working through the task of learning about influences of eugenics on psychology and society. As a part of this, I'm documenting the eugenics views held by many psychologists, as well as connections between psychologists and eugenics. 

Currently my research is highly disorganized, provisional, and unfolding across various blog posts. In this post I am interested in possible connections between eugenics and the Psychonomics Society, of which I am a member and fellow. I've been attending Psychonomics since the mid 2000s. I never really looked into the history and formation of Psychonomics. Let's do that with an eye out for eugenics. 

Before jumping in I will say a few things. First, I'm a 40 year old recently Cognitive Psychologist at Brooklyn College of CUNY. I've been around the cognition block in Canada and the US. It never occured to me, and I was never taught, that there were extraordinarily deep connections between eugenics and psychology in the US and Canada. In learning about these connection now, I am very dissappointed, and I am still learning. For a quick primer on some of the connections one could read @yakushkoEugenicsItsEvolution2019. Although, here one might get the sense that the "pre-history" of psychology (e.g., before 1950s) was heavily influenced by eugenics, and "didn't that just die away?".

I've been slowly tracing eugenics and psychology connections leading up to the cognitive revolution, and am about to continue forward past the 1950s. So, a good place to start is in my own backyard, in other words, does the Psychonomics Society have any eugenics connections? As a member I'd like to know.

@yakushkoEugenicsItsEvolution2019 had mentioned that 31 APA presidents from 1892 - 1947 were involved in eugenics in explicit ways (wrote on eugenics, members of eugenics societies, etc.). I found this shocking, and have started noting connections between [APA presidents and eugenics here](https://crumplab.github.io/blogposts/7_13_20_PsychEugenics/7_13_20_PsychEugenics.html). My assessment so far is that there are way more than 31 APA presidents who were deeply into eugenics.

Some books I have found useful in describing the vast ways with which eugenics permeated society and psychology are the following. @kuhlBettermentRaceRise2013 presents an astounding history of the international organization of eugenics movements, including some discussion of the organization of eugenics within the discipline of psychology. If you thought eugenics was just a minor historical detail, this book may change your mind. An important point here is to better understand the organized ways in which eugenicists were involved in leadership positions within societies and governments. These actions by eugenicists created deep structures of eugenics within society which continue to influence society today. @yakushkoScientificPollyannaismInquisition2019 presents a critical look at some aspects of scientific psychology, especially those rooted in eugenics and positive psychology. If you want a primer on some of atrocities committed by well-known psychologists, this is an eye-opener. It may also challenge some of your notions about the role of psychology as a science in society. Last, @pressEugenicMindProject discusses eugenics in the context of western Canada (I'm an Alberta boy), where the eugenics policy of forced sterilization was legalized; and he develops a "standpoint theory" of eugenics, which attempts to discuss eugenics from a survivor perspective, as well as advocate for modern society to understand hallmarks of eugenic thinking so as to guard against modern versions of eugenics campaigns. Wilson was also the project director for the wonderful website <http://eugenicsarchive.ca>.

I found one story in from Wilson very inspiring. It turns out the first chair of the Philosophy/Psychology Department at the University of Alberta was the same man who sat on the eugenics board and authorized forced sterilizations until the law was repealed. That department has an instituational legacy of eugenics. That department formed a sub committe in 1998 to assess its own legacy of eugenics, and do something in response for the purposes of restorative justice. I commend them for doing that. More Departments need to do this. More societies need to do this. Does Psychonomics need to do this? I don't know, maybe so...let's see.

A last word on labelling and offending people. As I am about to go into my own academic backyard and start asking whether my own colleagues have a history of espousing racist and eugenics ideology, I'm assuming some feathers may be ruffled.
My intention is to be constructive in learning about these issues and eventually portraying them back to the society (if there is anything to reflect on...haven't yet started the research). Certainly, some of the terminology may sound offensive, perjorative, and disparaging. However, labels such as "white racist-eugenicist-psychologist" are appopriate for psychologists, who explicitly in their own writing, identify themselves in those terms. For example, white racist-eugenicist-psychologists advocate for the supremacy of the "Nordic races" through positive eugenic policies, and advocate for the oppression,segregation and/or elimination of non-white races through negative eugenics policies.

I'm still thinking through how to discuss connections between eugenics and individual psychologists. For example, some psychologists may justify a label of racist-eugenicist because of their explicit self-identification under those terms, wherease, other psychologists may not because of a lack of explicit evidence. Nevertheless, I'll entertain the concept of adjacency in considering connections between eugenics and psychology. For example, many psychologists were trained by white racist eugenicists, or worked on topic areas that are of high interest to eugenicists. These psychologists are adjacent to eugenics in some important ways, and may or may not espouse eugenics ideology. In any case, I guess what I am saying is that I will attempt to use labels in a way that elucidates eugenics connections in psychology, for the purposes of understanding potential structural and systemic issues in our discipline that may be fundamentally related to eugenics. 

One question I have often wondered when I have attended Psychonomics is "Why is Psychonomics so white?". Given my newfound interest in eugenics, I am interested in determining whether structural eugenics in Psychology, including Psychonomics could possibly explain some of the overwhelming lack of diversity.

The above prelude is a work in progress where I am attempting to explain/discover my motivations for doing this work.

## History of Psychonomics

I must confess, I am a newbie when it comes to the history of Psychology, and specifically the history of its organizational structure in Canada and in the US. I've learned a couple things so far. E. G. Boring (1928 APA president) is often credited with starting the History of Psychology. When I read Boring, I find he doesn't do a good job of contextualizing the history of Psychology in terms of eugenics. I wonder why (I have my suspicions), he certainly worked with and knew a whole bunch of eugenicist psychologists, and it is incredible to believe that he didn't know about the ideologies of his colleagues. Maybe he thought the eugenics part was so obvious it went without saying...or maybe not.

As I write this I'm aware that I haven't read all of the History of Psych journals, so i don't know whether or how they reconstruct the history of Psychology from the lens of eugenics. Need to read more about this for myself.

There is a tradition in American Psychology of breaking away from the APA (American Psychological Association). The more I learn about the APA, the more I understand why. Psychonomics broke away from the APA, and before looking at that, I wanted to juxtapose the formation of Psychonomics with the formation of another society, [The Association of Black Psychology](http://www.abpsi.org) who has been publishing the [Journal of Black Psychology](https://journals.sagepub.com/home/jbp) since 1974. The ABPsi broke from the APA and in the last half-century have constructed an entire new field in Psychology, that is notable for several reasons, including the pursuit of restorative justice for the actions of white racist and eugenicist psychologists against the Black Community. So, I wonder if Psychonomics broke away from the APA for any related reasons...(hint not really).

## Plan for connecting dots

I went to the Psychonomics website <https://www.psychonomic.org/page/about>, and found that I could read four papers on the history of Psychonomics. Cool! Thanks Psychonomics. Let's start with the first paper.

Oops, I got interrupted. FYI, I'm going to write this like a detective novel, so it will be contemporaneous with my discoveries, and sometimes tangential. I admit, I already read the first paper, which is why I am going to talk more about it here. At the end of the paper there was some discussion about the word Psychonomics, and around that discussion there was some word usage common among eugenic texts. So, I ended up doing the thing I always do, but should have done from the beginning, and that is, Google "Psychonomics and eugenics". I did that and I straightaway I found a paper @clelandWarPeaceRevisited1979 published by the Psychonomic Society:

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("img/war.png")
```

This is an indication to me that the society at one point condoned aspects of eugenics, and also that some eugenics directed archaeology of Psychonomics is necessary. Edit, I recently learned that at this time (1979) members could publish in this venue effectively without scrutiny, so this paper could easily reflect more on the authors than on the society.

## The founding of Psychonomic Society

OK, back to the first paper on the history of Psychonomics. This one is titled, "The founding of the Psychonomics society" [@dewsburyFoundingPsychonomicSociety1995]. Before I go through it, it's worth reminding myself (I used to be a history major) what I learned about "history" in undergrad. There is opinion and perspective in historical retelling. What lens is used here to discuss the beginnings of Psychonomics? Historical retellings often use the same kinds of tricks. For example, @pressEugenicMindProject refers to Ebbinghaus' quip that "psychology has a long past, but only a short history". Wilson uses this quip to point out a common narrative structure in historical retelling. In histories of psychology as a science we see the "long" pointers back to the early Greek philosophers. It is often the case that "long" pointing is a way of using juxtaposition to connect some current issue with the significance or value of "well-accepted" historical figures. E.g., psychology is continues in the supremely wonderful and great tradition of the righteous and true great traditions of the past...That kind of thing. I'll have an eye out for the "long" pointers as I "read between the lines" of the "The founding of Psychonomics". Let's go.

Here's the first bit of the paper:

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("img/psycho1.png")
```

TLDR, the Psychonomics origin story begins with a bunch of white dudes at a bar. I can totally relate to that, because that is pretty much what my experience is like when I go to Psychonomics.

We learn that this meet-up was at a AAAS meeting (American Association for the Advancement of Science). Now, far be it from me to criticize the AAAS. And, I have not looked to closely at this organization yet. Suffice it to say, let me connect the AAAS with an important person in its history, James McKeen Cattell. Cattell is a notable eugenicist, as well he was an APA president, and he founded Psychological Review, and he bought Science and edited it for 50 years. I haven't read this paper yet, but it apparently covers some of the eugenic aspects of AAAS [@farberScientistsRoleEugenics2008].

OK, so some AAAS affiliated Psychologists go to a bar...and two years later Psychonomics was born. Some of those psychologists were "Clarence Graham of Columbia University, Clifford T. Morgan of Johns Hopkins, S. S. Stevens of Harvard, and William S. Verplanck of Hunter College." At some point I'll look into these individuals much in the same way I have looked at the APA presidents. I guess I need to start making a list though. And to be honest, I'd like a more structured database about individuals and their eugenics connections. Excel it is for now. I'll probably attempt connections between individuals after going through the paper, and for now make notes about the major players are.

So, after the origin story, the founding of Pscyhonomics is set in context of the tradition of splintering off from APA, which many other groups do for various reasons.

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("img/psycho2.png")
```

We are pulled back to into the living room of G. Stanley Hall in 1892, at the dawn of the APA. I would say that Hall was deeply into eugenics, [for some connections see](https://crumplab.github.io/blogposts/7_13_20_PsychEugenics/7_13_20_PsychEugenics.html#1892_granville_stanley_hall). I think it is also fair to say that the first presidential address published in the first issue of Psych Review in 1894 by George Trumball Ladd (2nd APA president, also frequent contributor to the Journal of Race Development...) was about establishing the place of psychology in Science. From the very beginning the eugenicists involved in Psychology were very eager to establish and maintain the scientific purity of Psychology. This a theme that sometimes is used to give psychologists cover to conduct "science" in a "value-free", "objectively neutral" way (see @yakushkoScientificPollyannaismInquisition2019 on scientism). FYI, I also think that Ladd was dog-whistling to the eugenicists in the crowd in his final thoughts about using psychology for the betterment of society. It is also highly interesting to inspect the first issue of Psych Review for known eugenicists (e.g., Francis Galton, founder of eugenics, publishes on his ability to arithmetic by smell).

Next, we learn about some previous splits within the APA. 

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("img/psycho3.png")
```

Would you be surprised if Leta Hollingworth was a racist and eugenicist? See here [wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leta_Stetter_Hollingworth). She was also married to another eugenicist psychologist Harry Levi Hollingworth, who was president of the APA in 1927. You could read Wallin's eugenics here [@wallinHygieneEugenicGeneration1914]. This split didn't last long and the APA recouped the AACP, and established the first "section" in the APA. Neato, I didn't know that.

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("img/psycho4.png")
```

There is an acknowledgement of the role that WW II played in the discipline of psychology. There are many connections between psychologists and war efforts in the US, and without going into that history, let me point out a primary theme is eugenics, and many of the psychologists involved were also members of eugenics societies. We see some mention of some other societies, like SEP (Society of Experimental Psychologists)...notably this exclusive honor club of psychologists still gives the Howard Crosby Warren medal every year as its primary honor award. HC Warren was another APA president (1913), and he is listed in the Eugenical News as an active researcher. But, the main point of this paragraph is the italicized two words "and practice", whereby the new bylaws of the APA included "
practice" alongside science, as a way into the APA. It seems like the scientists didn't like this very much.

We are then treated to a context of previous attempts to make scientific clubs of psychologists, where psychologists could just finally hang out and be scientists with each other.

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("img/p5.png")
```

The experimentalists were notable mysogynists, and they grew into the SEP, which maintained its misogynistic roots. I won't go into the membership of SEP, because this about Psychonomics, and SEP is another day.

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("img/p6.png")
```

Part of the point in this history could be to establish the "long" roots of Psychonomics by tying it to preceding exclusive honor societies. There is much cross-fertilization between the societies, as noted throughout this paper (and even today).

Next, we learn about earlier efforts by Titchener's group to create scientific space within APA conferences of the 20s.

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("img/p7.png")
```

I haven't found Titchener connect himself with eugenics in his writing, but Boring is certainly eugenics adjacent (having with worked with Yerkes in the army IQ testing effort). Dallenbach and Fernberger I don't know much about. Dallenbach was on an NRC committee with several other known eugenics proponents. Fernberger wrote a biography for HC Warren, wrote on "the problem of mental disorders", and seems eugenics adjacent at first glance. J. E. Anderson was APA president in 1943, and wrote "The Modern baby Book and Child Development Record", which follows in the footsteps of Galton's eugenics approach. Raymond Dodge was APA president in 1916, did some IQ testing during the war, and supported some eugenics policies, but doesn't appear to be a major public advocate of eugenics. Haven't looked into Robinson, but he writes about the great need to apply science to "the problem of public intelligence". Shepard like many his contemporaries worked in testing of the military during the war. 

It seems that this effort of organization didn't really work, and the group fizzled.

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("img/p8.png")
```

But, it's interesting that very notable people ("stalwarts") were in attendance: Harvey Carr, Clark Hull, Joseph Jastrow, H. C. Warren, and Robert S. Woodworth. T. All of these men are notably deeply into eugenics, and they are also all one-time presidents of the APA [see some notes on each here](https://crumplab.github.io/blogposts/7_13_20_PsychEugenics/7_13_20_PsychEugenics.html).

Huh, next we learn about another fascinating society in Psychology, the psychological round table, or PRT...If you followed my twitter account last summer, you would know that I tweeted a bunch about them. They are "well-kept-secret" honor society that still exists today. They have a smelly history of misogyny. The keep their member list close to their chests. Who knows what their members think about eugenics? It's just one of those questions that has to be asked in a blog post using the lens of eugenics to explore this paper.

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("img/p9.png")
```


```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("img/p10.png")
```

I think the TLDR here is that Psychonomics should be proud that among its founders were esteemed members of PRT. Congrats, give yourself a pat on the back.

PRT had GUV as a sister "secret society", so ya. Hi GUV friends, wave.

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("img/p11.png")
```


Again we have a list of names of well known psychologists. I'll point to one small puzzle. I know C. W. Eriksen because he invented the flanker task. I've been asking myself, what does that have to do eugenics? After all, I have used that task on numerous occasions. Well, the puzzle is not about the flanker task. Nope, it is why does C. W. Eriksen appear in a footnote in @kuhlBettermentRaceRise2013 book on eugenics? It's because Eriksen was among several other psychologists (who have deep eugenics connections) who signed a letter supporting [Arthur Jensen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Jensen), who has often been characterized as a racist psychologist.

from Kuhl:
"The ten other scholars were Jack A. Adams, Raymond B. Cattell, Francis H. Crick,
C. D. Darlington, Charles W. Eriksen, Eric F. Gardner, Quinn McNemar, Eliot Slater, Robert L. Thorndike, Frederick C. Thorne, and Philip E. Vernon; cf. JBA Oxford, G. 14. The activity was at first coordinated by the psychologist Ellis B. Page of the University of Connecticut; cf. Jensen to Dobzhansky, 9/2/1972, THA Philadelphia: Jensen, Arthur R."

Anyway, let's continue with the paper. 

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("img/p12.png")
```

Huh, I did not know that there was a failed attempt to remove division 3 (exp in psych) from APA in 1948. But, I certainly have learned somethings about big names in Experimental Psychology who were eugenicists, like Thorndike, Watson and Lashley. I haven't looked at Spence or Graham. For Spence I will just point out that we worked under Yerkes and Hull, so it seems very likely he was exposed to his mentors' eugenics. It would be interesting to look at Spence's scholarship from the lens of the eugenics ideology of his mentors.

Alright, we have arrived at the beginning of the Psychonomics Society:

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("img/p13.png")
```

Let's take a look at the table events:

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("img/p14.png")
```

More names:

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("img/p15.png")
```

And a table of membership of the organizing committee (from the American Men of Science):

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("img/p16.png")
```

Interesting to note the ages, so any members were all kicked out of PRT and GUV. Earlier in the paper we learned that 6 of these men were members of PRT.


More people get involved. I love how "diverse" and "white males" was working into the paragraph. 

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("img/p17.png")
```

There was some discussion and dissent about the purposes and directions of the new society. I wonder how much of that discussion had to do with restorative justice for survivors of eugenics at that time. I wasn't there, maybe it wasn't on the radar.

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("img/p18.png")
```

Some of the tension in the story appears to be the need to fight for science in psychology, and to make a society that shows everyone why science and psychology is so important. A story like this has been drilled into me over the years. IMO, Science shouldn't be an excuse to do psychology.

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("img/p19.png")
```

And now, we go back to the bar:

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("img/p20.png")
```

Should I go to Appendix D now, or later...it's choose your own adventure. Let's do it, Appendix D says :

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("img/p21.png")
```

For my two cents, the part at the bottom resonates very strongly. It seems there was an elitist contingent from the PRT. Ever wonder why graduate students don't give talks at Psychonomics? Maybe this is why. The elitists won.

Back to the paper. So, 950 invitations were sent out to potential members, the name Psychonomics was adopted and incorporated in 1960. There is an appendix on the name "Psychonomics". I'll get to that later.

"The First Annual Scientific Meeting of the Psychonomic Society
The first meeting of the Psychonomic Society was held at the University of Chicago on September 1-3, 1960, just before the 1960 APA meetings. Approximately 294 individuals attended, of whom 195were members, 79 were guests, and approximately 20 were unregistered. The program included 119 papers in 24 sessions arranged in eight time blocks with three concurrent sessions each; four blocks on Thursday, three blocks and an afternoon business meeting on Friday, and one block on Saturday morning. They were grouped into 15 categories. The nature of the experimental psychology ofthe time, at least for the members of the new Psychonomic Society, can be seen in the distribution of papers across sessions; these are presented in Table 3."

Let's look at Table 3:

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("img/p22.png")
```

Oh no, it seems that potpourri session has basically disappeared in terms of modern Psychonomics. Now, should I stay or should I go find the 1960 conference abstracts. I guess I should do that. I'm going to do that now, wish me luck.

No dice yet, couldn't find the conference abstracts after a quick search. Not sure which archive they are in. In any case, it would be interesting read about the genetics session and a few others.

Well, maybe spoke to soon. I can do things like search "paper presented to the Psychonomic Society, 2 September 1960" in Google scholar, and restrict the dates to 1960. Then a few papers that were read at psychonomics in 1960 come up. A start anyway. Here's an example, still would be nice to get the full list at some point.

- Jerison, H. J. (1961). Quantitative analysis of evolution of the brain in mammals. Science, 133(3457), 1012-1014.

Alright, some stuff happened at the first conference. We learn that it wasn't really too much different than division 3 APA conferences. Then there is the first business meeting, a first newsletter, etc.

Some thorns in the side, or additional reasons why Psychonomics needed to be created, it seems APA was making actual presentations of research more difficult. Kind of funny to imagine Estes' apparatus solution to the problem.

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("img/p23.png")
```

It seems that Psychonomics could be the place where science happened, and still be affiliated with the APA

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("img/p24.png")
```

What's in a name...Also, more in the appendix, which I will get to later. Also, some icky quotes in here...what's on page 5 !!!

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("img/p25.png")
```

Some membership features:

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("img/p26.png")
```

I guess this part went out the window, said the fellow researching the foundations of the fellow-less society he is a fellow of.

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("img/p27.png")
```

There was a distinct lack of diversity:

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("img/p28.png")
```

So this is why Psychonomics is just about coffee...keeps the cost of the conference down though (and I very much appreciate that...Also, I should say I very much appreciate Psychonomics, and the only reason I am spending this much time looking into the history of Psychonomics is because of how much I appreciate this society.)

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("img/p29.png")
```

Then some more stuff about restricting papers and talks to members. LET THE GRADUATE STUDENTS GIVE TALKS ALREADY. 

Governance structure is supposedly lean and in the style of PRT...not sure if that is good or bad. I've never been involved with governance at Psychonomics. Can't say anything about what it's like now.

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("img/p30.png")
```

Psychonomics journals didn't work out right away, but eventually started happening, courtesy of Clifford Morgan.

The concluding paragraph.

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("img/p31.png")
```

So a simple history of Psychonomics is that it is a lean organization for scientific psychologists to talk about their science. And it is does that very well.

Societies have many members and viewpoints and it's unclear what kinds of views Psychonomics members have had over time about issues such as eugenics, or about tolerating or not tolerating other members' views on such issues. 

---

Time for a small break. 

Aside from eugenics, I wonder how many folks from the governing board of Psychonomics and say all of the journals are also members of PRT and GUV? I would guess quite a few. If so, there is a "hidden" layer of elitism to the society, and if you are not part of the club...like moi, then I guess sucks to be you (or me as it happens).

---

On the naming of Psychonomics from the appendix:

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("img/p32.png")
```
 
I'll just point out that James Mark Baldwin also wrote, "The mental development in the child and race: methods and processes (Baldwin, 1900)". And, that curiously the word "flow" is often used in eugenics literature (see chpt 6 of @yakushkoScientificPollyannaismInquisition2019). These are obviously juxtaposition to eugenics, and I don't know the eugenics literature well enough yet to know if there are additional connections. Anyway, I thought these connections were worth noting.

---

There are three more papers on the history of Psychonomics on their website, and I'll read those a little bit later. Some of the next steps that I should take include looking more closely at the scholarship of the organizers. Considering the large amount of eugenics oriented research in the APA up to this time, and considering that Psychonomics was mainly planning to be a society that continued APA division 3 research, it would be surprising if the early days of Psychonomics did not include eugenics oriented research.

At the same time, we are now talking about 1960 and onward, a time in history when it became more unpopular to use the word eugenics (often attributed to widespread public rejection of eugenics following revelations of Nazi war crimes), and to talk openly about promoting eugenics. So, unlike pre 1945 where it was rather easy to line up psychologists who published in psychology and eugenics journals, or otherwise self-identified as being a eugenicist, it seems like more of a challenge to determine whether psychologists in the 60s were involved in eugenics. 

Before I start to look more closely at the scholarship of organizing members, I'd like to mention a few points of interest. For myself, I have been wondering about the connections between eugenics and the cognitive revolution. Psychonomics appears right in the same time frame as the cognitive revolution. I have spent many years thinking about cognition, and basically never thought of myself as contributing in anyway to programs of eugenics. I've been asking basic questions about basic psychological processes. How is that related to eugenics?

In any case, here are a few tidbits that have started to inform my thinking about the cognitive revolution. First, it is obvious that the history of individual differences psychology is tightly interwoven with eugenics. The development of IQ testing and psychometrics were employed as tools of eugenics many times over in many different venues in society. It was less obvious to me how experimental psychology was involved. One way was that many formative psychologists in experimental psychology were eugenicists, Thorndike, Watson, Lashley, Hull...the list goes on.

At one point I jumped ahead of myself (in terms of going through the APA presidents), and I looked George A. Miller & eugenics. Most of us know Miller for his magic number 7 + or - 2 paper. That paper was also  about applying ideas from Claude Shannon's information theory to information processing limitations in psychology. Well, guess where Claude Shannon did his master's thesis. At the eugenics record office in Cold Springs Harbor (Long Island New York). This is one of those weird eugenics connections. 

It took some googling but eventually I found George Miller explain his version of eugenics in 1967 in @millerPsychologicalPerspectivesYear1967. Miller inverts a common fear of morons that eugenicists usually foment about. Eugenicists like H. Goddard [@goddardWhoMoron1927] exclaim that morons are everywhere, they look like everyone else, but they are morons because of their IQ, and they must be removed from society or else society will collapse. Miller, in his futurism about the year 2000, says the society will become too complex rendering everyone morons, so basically we need to do something about it or else. Miller cryptically talks about when "the day comes that we have the necessary facts to support a realistic eugenics program, such information could be valuable." Miller doesn't say who he wishes to eliminate, he's cryptic. Still, he thanks his buddy R.J. Hernnstein at the beginning, probably for all the chats about eugenics (Hernnstein would later publish "the Bell curve").

Still, what did this have to do with cognition? Well, Miller also explains how it obvious that information processing capacity needs to be increased in order for society to survive. It's plain old Intelligence-exalting, fear-mongering, Galtonian eugenics with fancy words. So, there is some ideology between Miller's magic number. And it apparently has to do with eugenics.

Second, although I still have to confirm this, it appears that Abraham Maslow was deeply into eugenics, but only wrote about it privately, and this was only made generally available to public upon publishing of some of his private notes. 

I mention these two examples primarily because it may be difficult to suss out eugenic ideology among psychologists who don't share their views publicly, but continue nevertheless to conduct science that has eugenic implications. So, it's a bit of a warning to myself to not get carried away with wondering if someone is really a eugenicist or not. It's not for me to decide. One of primary aims is to document more clearly the structural eugenics aspects. In other words, I think at some point it will become clear enough that there was a bunch of eugenics going on, and that this shaped our discipline, and if this is true, it is something Psychonomics has to deal with.

## Psychonomics Originators

Eugenicists were very good at getting into the APA, especially as APA presidents. They were also very good at sitting as chairmen in US government committees (see the NRC 1919-1933 division of anthropology & Psychology). It would be kind of astounding to me if there was no interest among eugenicists in having a piece of Psychonomics from the very beginning. Let's take a look.

Also, what follows are personal notes, sometimes interspersed with "maybe" eugenic-adjacent things, sometimes things I'm interested in returning to for other reasons. After all, even though I have an interest in learning about psychology from the lens of eugenics, this is likewise an opportunity for me to learn about people I didn't know about before.

### Wendell R. Garner 

 - Had a meeting following SEP that was important for starting up Psychonomics
 - Sidenote, I always enjoyed reading Garner's ideas, especially inferred subsets.
 - Garner was the James Rowland Angell Professor of Psychology at Yale, [Angell of course was a eugenicist](https://crumplab.github.io/blogposts/7_13_20_PsychEugenics/7_13_20_PsychEugenics.html#1906_james_rowland_angell), so even if Garner wasn't he had to deal with this association. This is a pattern of structural eugenics.

  - read the part on personnel selection
 - if you read Garner without thinking about the context of eugenics, you might think he was just doing basic sensory psychology with a bit statistical uncertainty thrown in, and some apparent interest in rating scales...

### Lloyd G. Humphreys

 - IQ tester
 - accepted money from Pioneer Fund
 - from wikipedia: In the 1970s, Humphreys chaired the American Psychological Association's Task Force on ability and achievement testing. He deemed a general intelligence test "the single most important test that can be administered for vocational guidance purposes" (Humphreys, 1985, p. 211). He also coined the concept "inadequate learning syndrome" (ILS) and argued it was a more important social problem than the AIDS epidemic (Humphreys, 1988).
 - Amid the controversy generated by publication of The Bell Curve in 1994, Humphreys wrote a target article (Humphreys, 1994), which stimulated a series of comments by a number of prominent scholars in the field. He generated further controversy by accepting funding from the Pioneer Fund. He was also one of 52 signatories on "Mainstream Science on Intelligence,[3]" an editorial written by Linda Gottfredson and published in the Wall Street Journal, which defended the findings on intelligence in The Bell Curve.

### Clifford T. Morgan
 
 - From wikipedia: Clifford Thomas Morgan (July 21, 1915 – February 12, 1976)[1] was an American psychologist whose research was in the fields of physiological and experimental psychology. He was the author of the 1943 textbook Physiological Psychology, as well as a co-founder of the Psychonomic Society in 1959, of which he served as the first chairman.[2][3] He also established three academic journals from 1964 to 1966: Psychonomic Science, Psychonomic Monograph Supplements, and Perception & Psychophysics. He went on to give these journals to the Psychonomic Society in 1967.[4] In his honor, the Society for Behavioral Neuroscience and Comparative Psychology, Division 6 of the American Psychological Association, awards the Clifford T. Morgan Distinguished Service to Div. 6 Award.[5]

Temporary sidenote. At some point go through SEP membership. Many of the early members (from Boring's paper) were also on Eugenics councils.

The American Journal of Psychology publishes SEP notes

Running out of steam a bit. I've purused a bit through the journal [Psychonomic Science](https://link.springer.com/journal/40628/volumes-and-issues), which runs from 1964 to 1972. There are a smattering of papers that are eugenics adjacent IMO, but it mostly seems like fairly standard psychonomics fare. It's really great most of these papers are open access, I love this about Psychonomics. The journal also publishes some of the abstracts from Psychonomics conferences. I took a quick look at a few of them, and didn't see any more papers with eugenics in the title like this @clelandWarPeaceRevisited1979, which seems like a rarity. Also, the word "eugenic" and "eugenics" returns no results from the journal.


 


---

At some point I'll need to think about a scale for eugenics and individual psychologists. I'm not sure how this would work, it could be a point sytem, or a table of qualitative units. I'll use this space to think about eugenics and eugenics adjacent features that seem relevant.

Explicit features

 - member/researcher/leader of a eugenics society. E.g., self identified in the Eugencial News, or other Eugenics Society membership lists. 
 - advocates for eugenics in print either in academic work, or in other work
 
Adjacent Features

 - publishes in a eugenics journal
 - worked/trained by a known eugenicist
 - worked in institutions that were heavily influenced by eugenics, such as Yale's IHR
 - Signatory of letters supporting eugenicists/race science
 - intelligence testing
 - selection procedures (of people)
 - heredity/twin studies

Eugenics Adjacent research

It's clear that eugenics adjacent research exists, but much of it may be unlikely to be identified as such. That's fine. In using eugenics as a historical lens, it could be enough that this lens is useful for capturing aspects of psychonomic research in a new light.

For example, I would argue base on G. A. Miller's own words, that his research into information processing capacity limitations was eugenics adjacent research. Rather than IQ, Miller used bits and chunks to characterize bandwiths of information processing capacity, and he clearly saw this as important in the context of eugenics.

A larger issue looms for basic cognitive research. If one is studying a basic cognitive process, and one thinks about this process as having qualities of function that are good vs bad, or efficient vs inefficient, or desirable vs undesirable, and one intends to clarify how the process works for the purposes of identifying the quality of that process among individuals in a population, and then does this for the purpose of positive or negative eugenics...well, that would be eugenics wouldn't it. From my perspective, cognition should take an anti-eugenics stand, and commit to work and perspectives on the work that actively guard against eugenics.
