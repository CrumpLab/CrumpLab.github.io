I'm working through the task of learning about influences of eugenics on psychology and society. As a part of this, I'm reading Robert A. Wilson's, "The Eugenic Mind Project" [@pressEugenicMindProject]. I'll use this page to write notes about what I'm reading.

Wilson has circuitous path to writing this book. He's an Australian, has worked in US and Canada, now back in Melbourne. While in Edmonton, Alberta, he developed an interest in western Canadian eugenics and working with survivors of forced sterilization. He also was the project director for the [Eugenics Archives](http://eugenicsarchive.ca), which is a herculean effort by many people to create an online repository of knowledge around eugenics in Canada and the world.

## 1 Standpointing Eugenics

I'm only on pg. 2, but had to start writing. I'm not a social scientist, so have much to learn about theory and practice in that domain. Concurrently with researching eugenics I am also [reading through the Journal of Black Psychology](https://crumplab.github.io/blogposts/7_2_20_JBP/7_2_20_JBP.html). In this other avenue of reading, I am finding that I am overwhelmingly impoverished as a white male in understanding many Black issues. I have no lived experience as a Black person, how could I understand? I mention this because it connects to standpoint theory. I'd never heard of standpoint epistimology before, and Wilson summarizes it as, "standpoint theory emphasizes the positive value that thinking about knowledge and value from certain kinds of marginalized standpoint can have". The take home for me is that "lived experience" brings something valuable the table. I dig that very much. So, Wilson says he will present a standpoint eugenics, or at least a standpoint-ish eugenics. 

Wilson's eugenics in a nutshell, "Eugenics arose in the nineteenth centure both as a proposed, meliorative science--a science of human improvement or betterment-- and as a social movement...distinctive aim to use science/tech to regulate the sorts of people there would be in future generations". This is fairly neutral language for what was/is an aggressively racist and classist movement that has committed atrocities all around the world.

pg. 9, James Watson appointed to director of the Office of Human Genome Research 1988...Watson was director of Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory since 1968, [previously the Eugenics Record Office](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugenics_Record_Office), and has expressed several pro-eugenics views after leaving the directorship.

pg. 10, early 2000s 4/33 states that passed sterilization laws made apologies, following legal settlements in Alberta between survivors and the province that sterilized them

pg. 11 "...view of eugenics as simply a regrettable past..." this seems like a common and very unfortunate view of eugenics that needs to change. Especially given the "recent revelations of ongoing sterilizations in Australia, California, and India..."
