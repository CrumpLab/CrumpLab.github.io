I'm working through the task of learning about influences of eugenics on psychology and society. As a part of this, I'm documenting the eugenics views held by many psychologists, as well as connections between psychologists and eugenics. I will keep updating this page as I document the connections. There are many connections, it will take some time. So far, this is an emerging disorganized collection of factoids.

A major overarching goal of compiling and documenting connections between psychology and eugenics is to better understand how strucutural eugenics and racism in the discipline of Psychology has shaped and continues to shape the field, both in terms of the questions it asks, and who gets to ask them.

## Sir Francis Galton

  - Inventor of eugenics
  - effectively initiates individual differences psychology, for the purposes of eugenics
  - Obviously much more can be said about Galton...
  
## Karl Pearson

  - Eminent Statistician. Inventor of many common statistics (e.g., Pearson's R)
  - Galton appointed Pearson as the first Director of his Eugenics Laboratory at University College London, this is still in use today
  - The depths of Pearson's eugenics are apparent in his length effort to measure jewish children like animals, and apply his statistical tools to eliminating "bad" jews from immigrated to the UK [@pearsonProblemAlienImmigration1925]. This reference is part I of III, and continues for several hundred pages. To my mind, this work is obviously used as a blueprint by the Nazi's.
  
## Ronald Fisher

 - fill in refs 
  
## Alexander Graham Bell & Bell Labs

  - Notable figure who was a prominent eugenicist
  - Bell labs became central to the development of many communication technologies, and numerous important figures in the emerging discipline of cognitive science worked at Bell Labs. 
  - I need to look more into the culture of eugenics at Bell labs, but perhaps not surprisingly there appears to be one, e.g.,  [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Shockley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Shockley)
    
    
## Membership lists

I haven't found too many membership lists yet about affiliations with eugenics societies. So, just a few screenshots for now:

## American Psychological Presidents
 
 - @yakushkoEugenicsItsEvolution2019 writes that 31 APA presidents between 1892 -1947 were affiliated with or leaders in eugenics movements. Need to fill this list out (also it extends past 1947 as we will see)

### 1893 George Trumball Ladd
 
 - his presidential address is published in the first issue and volume of Psychological Review.

  - Some discussion of Stratton's role in driving research effort into African Americans [@yudellRaceUnmaskedBiology2014].

### 1909  Charles Hubbard Judd

  -  educational psychologist

### 1910  Walter Bowers Pillsbury

  - from [http://www.cyberus.ca/~pballan/Pillfina.htm](http://www.cyberus.ca/~pballan/Pillfina.htm): This personal brush with political prejudice did not change Pillsbury's official scientific stance on race and mental degeneracy. His Education as the Psychologist Sees It (1920), for instance, was part of a successful nationwide postwar marketing campaign advocating the use of new group "mental testing" techniques in American schools. Here, Pillsbury uncritically combined past eugenic twin-studies with the new "Army Alpha and Beta" intelligence testing data. Surprisingly, his personal conclusion after thirty-three years of teaching is "that one can never produce intelligence by education, that one must begin much farther back in actually insuring the birth of intelligent people" (p. 46). [p. 525] At this time, however, Pillsbury was just one of many psychologists who accepted such notions (e.g., R. M. Yerkes, Psychological Examination in the United States Army [1921]; W. S. Hunter, General Psychology [1919]; R. S. Woodworth, Psychology [1921]).

### 1911  Carl Emil Seashore

 - did some IQ testing in the war
 
 
### 1917  Robert Mearns Yerkes

  - Implemented the Alpha and Beta IQ tests on the Army (1.5 - 2 million army men tested).
  - Pretty clear from his report [@yerkesEugenicBearingMeasurements1923], that he wanted the tests to validate whites becoming officers, and "morons" and immigrants and blacks to be fodder for the front line, or otherwise eliminated

 - detailed analysis of Lashley's racism and hereditarianism @weidmanConstructingScientificPsychology1999
 
### 1930 Herbert Sidney Langfeld

 - writes on eugenics related issues here @langfeldIIHeredityExperience1949, but focuses more on the nature/nuture debate, and seems to take a neutral side on eugenics, which references in terms of "political" takes on the issues. 
 
### 1931 Walther Samuel Hunter

 - From wikipedia, this is a perfect description of accidental eugenics, "Hunter served in the military for sixteen months during World War I. He was the chief psychological examiner in three army camps.[2] During that time he compiled bar graphs with E.S. Jones that showed the predictive value of group psychological tests.[3] His work persuaded government officials to continue the testing program, which ultimately led military officials to order the recording of data on the national origins of the troops tested.[3] The data collected was used in a way that Hunter did not approve; combining the psychological test scores with the location of where the individual grew up supported the notion of Nordic superiority, which was not his intention.[3]"
 - Might be worth reading Hunter's delayed reaction research in animals and children [@hunterDelayedReactionChild1917]. On the hand, it seems that Yerkes advocated that tests of delayed reaction ability could distinguish humans from infra-humans. And, on the other hand, the results were used in the context of debate about mental representations.
 
### 1932  Walter Richard Miles
 - hired by Terman at Stanford, trained by Carl Seashore, married a psychologist who studied gifted children.
 - A funny story about not getting to meet Pearson on a lab visit [https://thepsychologist.bps.org.uk/volume-25/edition-8/looking-back-walter-miles-and-his-grand-tour](https://thepsychologist.bps.org.uk/volume-25/edition-8/looking-back-walter-miles-and-his-grand-tour)
 - wrote a biography of RM Yerkes. Miles, W. R. (1946). Robert Mearns Yerkes. American Psychologist, 1(6), 175–178. This biography leaves out Yerkes' eugenics. Although it show a painting of Yerkes set in front of a tree, which seemse obviously connected to his eugenics.
 - did a bunch of intelligence testing work
 - @milesTRAININGPRACTICEMENTAL1935 talks around eugenics issues and human superiority in terms of longevity, calls for more developmental research in the tradition of Cattell's individual difference work.
 
### 1933 Leon Luis Thurstone

  - famous for his statistical approaches to intelligence testing. 
  - So far haven't read Thurstone closely and haven't found clear indications of his views on eugenics. However, it is interesting to read comments on his work by eugenicists (e.g., @thomsonTRENDNATIONALINTELLIGENCE1946). So, how does Thurstone explain his work knowing that eugenicists are highly interested in it for the purposes of eugenics?
  - consider Thurstone in the context of racist ideologies of the time @samelsonRacePsychologyStudies1978
  
### 1934 Joseph Peterson

 - Peterson, J., & Lanier, L. H. (1929). Studies in the comparative abilities of whites and negroes. Mental Measurement Monographs.
    - where they conclude whites are superior.
 
### 1935  Albert Theodore Poffenberger

 - Relation to Thomas Poffenberger? of Poffenberger, T. (1963). Two thousand voluntary vasectomies performed in California: background factors and comments. Marriage and Family Living, 25(4), 469-474.
 - Generally an advocate for appling testing everywhere to make sure everyone goes into their pre-ordained slot in life.
 - Some work on testing and predicting success in life from school grades. Poffenberger, A.T. (1925). School achievement and success in life. Journal of Applied Psychology, 9(1), 22–28.
 - Poffenberger, A. T., & Carpenter, F. L. (1924). Character Traits in School Success. Journal of Experimental Psychology, 7(1), 67–74. This paper is a good example of value-free science. There is an effort to expand testing in schools beyond IQ tests to include other tests measuring traits that also predict performance...e.g., fill in the gaps that IQ misses in terms of variance explained. However, very little is said about what how these tests would be used in society, even though it is clear from the authors own collegial associations that "better" tests would certainly be put to use for eugenics purposes.
 - @poffenbergerMeasuresIntelligenceCharacter1922 This paper is basically full on eugenics without using the word. Poffenberger describes how IQ tests can be used to slot people into professions that they are "suitable" for given their IQ. It is an argument to keep "low IQ workers" in their place as laborers, and given the best jobs to people with high IQ, and to worry about how the economy may collapse if people aren't slotted in based on their IQ.
 
 - @poffenbergerDevelopmentMenScience1930 carries on in the tradition of Galton & Cattell to ask what factors make men of science great. Maintains a thin veneer with respect to avoiding commentary on eugenics.
 - Highly relevant account of the activities of the national research council 1919-1933 (division of anthropology & Psychology), wherein it obvious just how many activities were eugenic in nature. @poffenbergerVIIIDIVISIONANTHROPOLOGY1933
   - consider also the previous chairmen of the committee:

## Henry Goddard

 - Goddard argued for classifying “feeble-minded” people into classes by IQ, e.g., idiots ~ 20, Imbeciles ~ 40, Morons ~ 70, see Goddard’s “Who is a Moron?” [@goddardWhoMoron1927]. 
 - The fear was that morons are basically normal competent people who are able to hide in society, but they will also destroy the human race if they are allowed to breed. The only way to discover morons was to IQ test them, and then employ eugenics polices to prevent morons from breeding.

## Eugenics Publications

- Eugenical News
- The Eugenics Review
- Psychological Index had some eugenics sections
- The Journal of Race development

## Institutional considerations

Part of the impetus for all of this research is to characterize the widespread acceptance of eugenics in terms of institutions. So far my perspective is that psychology as a discipline has a problem with instutional forms of eugenics and racism. Institutional eugenics is term that could carry broad meaning from literal institutions (e.g., such as the APA), to widely adopted policies in society inspired and propagated by eugenics leaders (e.g., IQ testing).

Some American Institutions to consider in terms of Psychology & Eugenics

- Individual Psychology departments
- APA leadership (See presidents list above)
- SEP membership (honorary societies in psychology)
- AAAS 
- Federal government research councils and chairs
