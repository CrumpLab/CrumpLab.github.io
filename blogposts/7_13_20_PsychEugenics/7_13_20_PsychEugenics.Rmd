I'm working through the task of learning about influences of eugenics on psychology and society. As a part of this, I'm documenting the eugenics views held by many psychologists, as well as connections between psychologists and eugenics. I will keep updating this page as I document the connections. There are many connections, it will take some time. So far, this is an emerging disorganized collection of factoids.

A major overarching goal of compiling and documenting connections between psychology and eugenics is to better understand how strucutural eugenics and racism in the discipline of Psychology has shaped and continues to shape the field, both in terms of the questions it asks, and who gets to ask them.

## Sir Francis Galton

  - Inventor of eugenics
  - effectively initiates individual differences psychology, for the purposes of eugenics
  - Obviously much more can be said about Galton...
  
## Karl Pearson

  - Eminent Statistician. Inventor of many common statistics (e.g., Pearson's R)
  - Galton appointed Pearson as the first Director of his Eugenics Laboratory at University College London, this is still in use today
  - The depths of Pearson's eugenics are apparent in his length effort to measure jewish children like animals, and apply his statistical tools to eliminating "bad" jews from immigrated to the UK [@pearsonProblemAlienImmigration1925]. This reference is part I of III, and continues for several hundred pages. To my mind, this work is obviously used as a blueprint by the Nazi's.
  
## Ronald Fisher

 - fill in refs 
  
## Alexander Graham Bell & Bell Labs

  - Notable figure who was a prominent eugenicist
  - Bell labs became central to the development of many communication technologies, and numerous important figures in the emerging discipline of cognitive science worked at Bell Labs. 
  - I need to look more into the culture of eugenics at Bell labs, but perhaps not surprisingly there appears to be one, e.g.,  [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Shockley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Shockley)
    
    
## Membership lists

I haven't found too many membership lists yet about affiliations with eugenics societies. So, just a few screenshots for now:

### 1893 George Trumball Ladd
 
 - his presidential address is published in the first issue and volume of Psychological Review.

### 1909  Charles Hubbard Judd

  -  educational psychologist

### 1910  Walter Bowers Pillsbury

  - from [http://www.cyberus.ca/~pballan/Pillfina.htm](http://www.cyberus.ca/~pballan/Pillfina.htm): This personal brush with political prejudice did not change Pillsbury's official scientific stance on race and mental degeneracy. His Education as the Psychologist Sees It (1920), for instance, was part of a successful nationwide postwar marketing campaign advocating the use of new group "mental testing" techniques in American schools. Here, Pillsbury uncritically combined past eugenic twin-studies with the new "Army Alpha and Beta" intelligence testing data. Surprisingly, his personal conclusion after thirty-three years of teaching is "that one can never produce intelligence by education, that one must begin much farther back in actually insuring the birth of intelligent people" (p. 46). [p. 525] At this time, however, Pillsbury was just one of many psychologists who accepted such notions (e.g., R. M. Yerkes, Psychological Examination in the United States Army [1921]; W. S. Hunter, General Psychology [1919]; R. S. Woodworth, Psychology [1921]).

### 1911  Carl Emil Seashore

   - Read yakushko's chapter on Watson in Scientific Pollyanaism
 
### 1916 Raymond Dodge

 - From Doyle, "Dodge was also pleased that his research in human variability and psycho- psychology was so valued by the prospective Institute. While Dodge never publicly identified as a eugenicist, he applauded the National Origins Act of 1924 and was a proponent of applying psychological research to public discourse on selective immigration.93"
 - did some IQ testing in the war
 
 
### 1917  Robert Mearns Yerkes

  - Implemented the Alpha and Beta IQ tests on the Army (1.5 - 2 million army men tested).
  - Pretty clear from his report [@yerkesEugenicBearingMeasurements1923], that he wanted the tests to validate whites becoming officers, and "morons" and immigrants and blacks to be fodder for the front line, or otherwise eliminated
  - Member of Advisory Council: International commission on eugenics, Eugenics committee of the United States of America
  - Yerkes, R. M. (1918). Psychology in relation to the war. Psychological Review, 25(2), 85–115.

### 1921 Margaret Floy Washburn
  
  - first woman to get a Ph.D. in Pysch
  - studied under Cattell & Titchener, did comparative cognitive
  - from Yakushko, "M. Washburn, APA president in 1921, one of few female APA presidents, not only published positive reviews of eugenic books but also produced studies on supposed differences in national character showing the “striking national difference” apparently found between Jewish participants' lack of empathy in contrast to their non‐Jewish counterparts (Washburn, 1923, p. 429)."

 - Haven't found specific eugenic writing
 
### 1927 Harry Levi Hollingworth

 -  advocates for eugenics in the book "Vocational Psychology" @hollingworthVocationalPsychologyIts1916
 
### 1928  Edwin Garrigues Boring

 - credited with founding the history of psychology discipline
 - worked with Yerkes doing IQ testing in the military
 - Eugenics views unclear, seems to not discuss the topic so much when he writes his histories
 
### 1929 Karl Lashley

 - detailed analysis of Lashley's racism and hereditarianism @weidmanConstructingScientificPsychology1999
 
### 1930 Herbert Sidney Langfeld

 - writes on eugenics related issues here @langfeldIIHeredityExperience1949, but focuses more on the nature/nuture debate, and seems to take a neutral side on eugenics, which references in terms of "political" takes on the issues. 
 
### 1931 Walther Samuel Hunter

 - From wikipedia, this is a perfect description of accidental eugenics, "Hunter served in the military for sixteen months during World War I. He was the chief psychological examiner in three army camps.[2] During that time he compiled bar graphs with E.S. Jones that showed the predictive value of group psychological tests.[3] His work persuaded government officials to continue the testing program, which ultimately led military officials to order the recording of data on the national origins of the troops tested.[3] The data collected was used in a way that Hunter did not approve; combining the psychological test scores with the location of where the individual grew up supported the notion of Nordic superiority, which was not his intention.[3]"
 - Might be worth reading Hunter's delayed reaction research in animals and children [@hunterDelayedReactionChild1917]. On the hand, it seems that Yerkes advocated that tests of delayed reaction ability could distinguish humans from infra-humans. And, on the other hand, the results were used in the context of debate about mental representations.
 
### 1932  Walter Richard Miles
 - hired by Terman at Stanford, trained by Carl Seashore, married a psychologist who studied gifted children.
 - A funny story about not getting to meet Pearson on a lab visit [https://thepsychologist.bps.org.uk/volume-25/edition-8/looking-back-walter-miles-and-his-grand-tour](https://thepsychologist.bps.org.uk/volume-25/edition-8/looking-back-walter-miles-and-his-grand-tour)
 - wrote a biography of RM Yerkes. Miles, W. R. (1946). Robert Mearns Yerkes. American Psychologist, 1(6), 175–178. This biography leaves out Yerkes' eugenics. Although it show a painting of Yerkes set in front of a tree, which seemse obviously connected to his eugenics.
 - did a bunch of intelligence testing work
 - @milesTRAININGPRACTICEMENTAL1935 talks around eugenics issues and human superiority in terms of longevity, calls for more developmental research in the tradition of Cattell's individual difference work.
 
### 1933 Leon Luis Thurstone

  - famous for his statistical approaches to intelligence testing. 
  - So far haven't read Thurstone closely and haven't found clear indications of his views on eugenics. However, it is interesting to read comments on his work by eugenicists (e.g., @thomsonTRENDNATIONALINTELLIGENCE1946). So, how does Thurstone explain his work knowing that eugenicists are highly interested in it for the purposes of eugenics?
  - consider Thurstone in the context of racist ideologies of the time @samelsonRacePsychologyStudies1978
  
### 1934 Joseph Peterson

 - Peterson, J., & Lanier, L. H. (1929). Studies in the comparative abilities of whites and negroes. Mental Measurement Monographs.
    - where they conclude whites are superior.
 
### 1935  Albert Theodore Poffenberger

 - Relation to Thomas Poffenberger? of Poffenberger, T. (1963). Two thousand voluntary vasectomies performed in California: background factors and comments. Marriage and Family Living, 25(4), 469-474.
 - Generally an advocate for appling testing everywhere to make sure everyone goes into their pre-ordained slot in life.
 - Some work on testing and predicting success in life from school grades. Poffenberger, A.T. (1925). School achievement and success in life. Journal of Applied Psychology, 9(1), 22–28.
 - Poffenberger, A. T., & Carpenter, F. L. (1924). Character Traits in School Success. Journal of Experimental Psychology, 7(1), 67–74. This paper is a good example of value-free science. There is an effort to expand testing in schools beyond IQ tests to include other tests measuring traits that also predict performance...e.g., fill in the gaps that IQ misses in terms of variance explained. However, very little is said about what how these tests would be used in society, even though it is clear from the authors own collegial associations that "better" tests would certainly be put to use for eugenics purposes.
 - @poffenbergerMeasuresIntelligenceCharacter1922 This paper is basically full on eugenics without using the word. Poffenberger describes how IQ tests can be used to slot people into professions that they are "suitable" for given their IQ. It is an argument to keep "low IQ workers" in their place as laborers, and given the best jobs to people with high IQ, and to worry about how the economy may collapse if people aren't slotted in based on their IQ.
 
 - @poffenbergerDevelopmentMenScience1930 carries on in the tradition of Galton & Cattell to ask what factors make men of science great. Maintains a thin veneer with respect to avoiding commentary on eugenics.
 - Highly relevant account of the activities of the national research council 1919-1933 (division of anthropology & Psychology), wherein it obvious just how many activities were eugenic in nature. @poffenbergerVIIIDIVISIONANTHROPOLOGY1933

## First 50 notes

I need to pause for a bit. I've been quickly trying to sketch out some connections between APA presidents and eugenics. Mostly this involves googling their name and eugenics, and pulling the string.

My main aim in making these connections is to draw attention to the larger pattern of institutional eugenics within the discipline of Psychology. I am less interested about whether or not specific individuals were "card-carrying" eugenicists, or really truly held eugenics views in their "soul" or not. I think it is enough to establish the pattern and spread of eugenic ideology to consider how eugenics shaped the discipline. For example, I suspect that rampant eugenics had a part to play in systemically limiting the diversity of faculty in Psychology. I suspect it also guided the questions we ask, and continue to ask.

So, as a part of reflecting on what I am doing, I drew up a quick spreadsheet of the APP presidents. For the first 50, I gave them each a eugenics score from 0 to 1, with some intermediate scores representing eugenics adjacent work. These are just some rough personal qualitative estimates, to put a number on things. My rough numberization adds up to 34.75 of 50 APA presidents were into eugenics or eugenics adjacent research. Very few were ever explicitly anti-eugenics.

Consider a sentence like, "It is overwhelming the case that the first 50 years of American Psychology as measured by APA presidents research interests and leadership demonstrate that the discpline of psychology was primarily constructed as arm of the national eugenics movement in the USA". I just wrote that sentence, and I'm starting to think that I'm not exaggerating.

  - "Hobart Mowrer was an advocate of the idea that mental illness has a substantial biological and genetic basis. He held this conviction in spite of his equally strong belief in the importance of the "pathogenic secret." Mowrer accepted the importance of biological factors at a time when many people did not, and was in this respect ahead of his time. He regarded his own affliction as in some sense a "gift," the driving force behind his innovative ideas, but also the great misery of his life."

 - from Kuhl
   - "Student-led protests, sometimes violent in nature, against public appearances by Jensen, Eysenck, and Shockley produced a situation wherein they perceived a dichotomy between politically blinded critics and “pure” scholars, who were subject to psychoterror, attempts at intimidation, and death threats.123 Eysenck, Jensen, and Herrnstein, in conjunction with ten other American and British academics, suc- ceeded in initiating a resolution defending them against “personal and professional disparagement.”124 Here they placed the criticism that they received for their theory of inheritance in the same tradition as the persecution of “well-known scientist victims, includ[ing],Galileo, in orthodox Italy; Darwin, in Victorian England; Einstein, in Hitler’s Germany; and Mendelian biologists, in Stalin’s Russia.”125 Many of the attacks against the heredity researchers were seen to be made by “non- scientists” or “outspoken enemies of a scientific attitude.” Attacks were also deemed to come from “academics who had determined that any explanation of differences among humans could be traced to the environmental theory.” In the light of the widespread “environment oriented orthodoxy,” there was practically a “witch hunt” against those who held ideas based on heredity or a wish to develop further research work in the area of the biological bases of behavior.
   - Notes from 124, "The ten other scholars were Jack A. Adams, Raymond B. Cattell, Francis H. Crick, C. D. Darlington, Charles W. Eriksen, Eric F. Gardner, Quinn McNemar, Eliot Slater, Robert L. Thorndike, Frederick C. Thorne, and Philip E. Vernon; cf. JBA Oxford, G. 14. The activity was at first coordinated by the psychologist Ellis B. Page of the University of Connecticut; cf. Jensen to Dobzhansky, 9/2/1972, THA Philadelphia: Jensen, Arthur R."
 



  
## Henry Goddard

 - Goddard argued for classifying “feeble-minded” people into classes by IQ, e.g., idiots ~ 20, Imbeciles ~ 40, Morons ~ 70, see Goddard’s “Who is a Moron?” [@goddardWhoMoron1927]. 
 - The fear was that morons are basically normal competent people who are able to hide in society, but they will also destroy the human race if they are allowed to breed. The only way to discover morons was to IQ test them, and then employ eugenics polices to prevent morons from breeding.

 - switched to invent information theory aftwerward

## George A. Miller
 
 - wrote on eugenics in Daedalus, @millerPsychologicalPerspectivesYear1967

## Abraham Maslow

 - Posthumous journal notes suggest his humanism was rooted in eugenics
 - @maslowJournalsAbrahamMaslow1982


## Eugenics Publications

- Eugenical News
- The Eugenics Review
- Psychological Index had some eugenics sections
- The Journal of Race development

## Institutional considerations

Part of the impetus for all of this research is to characterize the widespread acceptance of eugenics in terms of institutions. So far my perspective is that psychology as a discipline has a problem with instutional forms of eugenics and racism. Institutional eugenics is term that could carry broad meaning from literal institutions (e.g., such as the APA), to widely adopted policies in society inspired and propagated by eugenics leaders (e.g., IQ testing).

Some American Institutions to consider in terms of Psychology & Eugenics

- Individual Psychology departments
- APA leadership (See presidents list above)
- SEP membership (honorary societies in psychology)
- AAAS 
- Federal government research councils and chairs

Snippets from Kuhl:

Look up Psychologists of the IFEO psychology committee, like [W. Stephenson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Stephenson_(psychologist))

The American eugeni-
cists continued their research and publication activity unhindered, and in August 1915,
55 the National Conference for Race Betterment met for the second time

the antiracist reinterpretation of the American army intelligence tests in the First World War by the New York anthropologist Otto Klineberg

The second committee, which included the British eugenicists and psychologists Charles Spearman and W. R. S. Stephenson as well as the American researcher on race Morris Steggerda was tasked with making uniform the intelligence tests developed in Europe and America and revising these tests in a way that they could be used for the “psychological examination” of “non- European and primitive peoples.”67 In that way, not only could a direct evaluation of each individual be made possible, but the presumably intellectual abilities and characteristics of the races could be shown quantitatively.

The IFEO Commission for Race Psychiatry that was set up in 1930 was assigned the task of bringing out these differences in the mental and psychological constitu- tion of races.

 The psychologist Clariette Armstrong, a former member of the Eugenics Research Association, testi- fied to the court for the IAAEE how great a hardship it would be for the Negro child to be in school with brighter, younger Whites, leading to greater delinquency, and so on.59 The IAAEE published and distributed arguments by Henry E.

Arthur Jensen,

Hans J. Eysenck

Richard Herrnstein, a psychologist at Harvard University, picked up on Jensen’s and Eysenck’s hypotheses.

J. Philippe Rushton, a Canadian professor of psychology, not only received exten- sive support from the Pioneer Fund but after the turn of the century also took over leadership of the fund.

Eysenck, Jensen, and Herrnstein, in conjunction with ten other American and British academics, suc- ceeded in initiating a resolution defending them against “personal and professional disparagement.”124

For many years a large part of the project funds of the Pioneer Fund went for a research project on twins at the University of Minnesota, but the fund has also been involved in almost every piece of research that is intended to determine the psy- chological differences between the races.144 Arthur Jensen alone between 1971 and 1992 received over a million dollars. J. Phillippe Rushton in the same period was able to receive over $770,000 in grant funds from Pioneer. William Shockley, who promoted breeding of the highly gifted and to this end made his own sperm avail- able, received about $200,000 for his various activities in the area of race research. Other race researchers as well, such as the professor of education and psychologist R. Travis Osborne, the psychologist Richard Lynn, the sociologist and professor of education Linda Gottfredson, the sociologist Robert Gordon, and the philosopher Michael Levin, received generous amounts from the Pioneer Fund.145
