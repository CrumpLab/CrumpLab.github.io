  abstract = {An examination of eugenic thinking past and present, from forced sterilization to prenatal screening, drawing on experience with those who survived ~eugenics.
                Part science and part social movement, eugenics emerged in the late nineteenth century as a tool for human improvement. In response to perceived threats of criminality, moral degeneration, feeble-mindedness, and “the rising tide of color,” eugenic laws and social policies aimed to better the human race by regulating reproductive choice through science and technology. In this book, Rob Wilson examines eugenic thought and practice—from forced sterilization to prenatal screening—drawing on his experience working with eugenics survivors.~ Using the social sciences' standpoint theory as a framework to understand the intersection of eugenics, disability, social inclusiveness, and human variation, Wilson focuses on those who have lived through a eugenic past and those confronted by the legacy of eugenic thinking today.~ By doing so, he brings eugenics from the distant past to the ongoing present.~Wilson discusses such topics as the conceptualization of eugenic traits; the formulation of laws regulating immigration and marriage and requiring sexual sterilization; the depiction of the targets of eugenics as “subhuman”; ~the systematic construction of a concept of normality; the eugenic logic in prenatal screening and contemporary bioethics; and the incorporation of eugenics and disability into standpoint theory.~Individual purchasers of this book will receive free access to the documentary~Surviving Eugenics, available at EugenicsArchive.ca/film.},

  abstract = {Since its inception Western academic psychology has been influenced by and closely affiliated with eugenics, defined by its originators as the “science of racial betterment.” The role of eugenics has been minimally acknowledged in historical accounts of Western psychology, although it was fundamental to the establishment of empirical psychology methods as well as its applied theories, specifically behaviorism. The continued influence of eugenics in Western psychology, noted in this article, is traced to biologizing human differences while minimizing the role of social context as well as to dividing individuals into groups according to their supposedly innate fitness levels (such as intelligence and optimism). The impact of eugenics on the practice of psychotherapy is highlighted.},

The concept of race has been at the center of both triumphs and tragedies in American history and has had a profound effect on the human experience. Race Unmasked revisits the origins of commonly held beliefs about the scientific nature of racial differences, examines the roots of the modern idea of race, and explains why race continues to generate controversy as a tool of classification even in our genomic age.Surveying the work of some of the twentieth century's most notable scientists, Race Unmasked reveals how genetics and related biological disciplines formed and preserved ideas of race and, at times, racism. A gripping history of science and scientists, Race Unmasked elucidates the limitations of a racial worldview and throws the contours of our current and evolving understanding of human diversity into sharp relief.},

  abstract = {The author presents facts and principles of the basic sciences of man and especially of psychology with an emphasis upon the nature, causation, and modification of abilities and needs. Part I consisting of 15 chapters is more technical than Part II and deals with abilities, the nature and measurement of wants, mental dynamics, individual differences, the interaction of genes and environments, conflicts of wants, conscience, judgments about values, and facts concerning the possibility and desirability of a natural science of values with reference to its problems, methods, and results. In the final chapter of this section, entitled "Living by Science," the author answers the critics of the aims and methods of science contending that science neither destroys nor conflicts with the freedom, purposes, and imagination of the human race. In 23 chapters comprising Part II the author proceeds to discuss the science of philanthropy and the ways and means of improving the welfare of the present and future generations, natural resources and capital, labor and management, buying and selling, money and credit, ownership, human relations, the function, criteria and operations of good government, and the role of law in its effect upon human nature. The final chapter summarizes the author's social philosophy and a program for the betterment of humanity. The first part concerns "getting better men, providing them with better training, and arranging for the best of them to have more power" while the second is concerned with improving the environment of institutions and customs. Six appendices supplement the text. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},
