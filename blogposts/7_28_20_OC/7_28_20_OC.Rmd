I don't really blog about synthesizers, but I like them, and I am slowly building a modular eurorack system. I've been playing around with [Ornament and Crime](https://ornament-and-cri.me), and then recently installed the alternative firmware [hemisphere suite](https://github.com/Chysn/O_C-HemisphereSuite/wiki) by Chysn. Both firmwares are very good. I forked the Hemisphere repo, and am now trying to code my own applets using the hemisphere approach. Using this page to make some notes as I go along.

I got started messing with O_C yesterday, and made some decent progress (although I don't really know C++, so it's slow going).
