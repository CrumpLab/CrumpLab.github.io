I've been using R Markdown to generate my lab website for some time now. I recently switched from the [generic R markdown website](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-13.html) to a website generated by [pkgdown](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org). I've been happy with the result. As a part of the migration, I'm revisiting individual pages like my [publications list](https://www.crumplab.com/articles/Publications.html)
