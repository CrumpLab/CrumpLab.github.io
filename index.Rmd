This is Yifei, a master student major in cognitive neuroscience at Beijing Normal University. Studying in Chinese's Top 1 brain research institute, I am conducting research on several domains under the supervison of Prof. [Xue, Gui](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Gyms-jgAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN). My current research interest includes: (1) uncovering the mental structure of human intelligence using both behavioural and meuroimaging approaches, (2) investigating the cognitive and neural basis of human cognitive control combining computational and neuroscience models, (3) finding the efficient way of training executive functions of different age period.

During my undergraduate and master years, by leading and participating several research projects, I have gained some different research skills including: (1) data analysis using R programming, Python, and Matlab, (2) brhavioral test programming using PsychoPy, E-prime, and PsychToolbox, (3) neuroimaging techniques such as fMRI, EEG, MEG, and fNIRS, (4) academic writing (see my [publications](https://yifeicao.github.io/YifeiCaoWebsite/Publications.html)).

If you are interested in something about me (e.g., recruiting me as your PhD candidate, or having question regarding my previous research etc.), please feel free to send me e-mail, or DM me via [twitter](https://twitter.com/YifeiBNU1)
