The Computational Cognition Lab at Brooklyn College of CUNY investigates learning, memory, attention, performance, and semantic cognition.

[Current and previous lab members](https://crumplab.github.io/People.html) include undergraduate, master's , doctoral, and postdoctoral researcher associates.

The lab is located in the [Department of Psychology](http://www.brooklyn.cuny.edu/web/academics/schools/naturalsciences/undergraduate/psychology.php) at [Brooklyn College of CUNY](http://www.brooklyn.cuny.edu/), and affiliated with the [Cognitive and Comparative Psychology Training area](https://ccp-cuny.github.io) of the [Psychology Doctoral program at the Graduate Center of CUNY](https://www.gc.cuny.edu/Page-Elements/Academics-Research-Centers-Initiatives/Doctoral-Programs/Psychology/Training-Areas/Cognitive-and-Comparative-Psychology).
