There are lots of foundational papers in Cognitive Psychology. Here are a few of my favorites.

Before the list, Cho, Tse, & Neely (2012, see the list for the full reference), have an excellent appendix of the top 500 most cited papers in cognitive psychology spanning 1950 - 2004. Lots of good things to read in there.

Also, apologies for badly formatted references. Theses were all imported from google scholar into zotero, then compiled into a bibliography. When I get the chance I will fix them, but for now, blame Google.
