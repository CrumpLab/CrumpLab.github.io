abstract: "Recent research in the artificial grammar literature has found that a simple explicit model of memory can account for a wide variety of artificial grammar results (Jamieson & Mewhort, 2009, 2010, 2011). This classic of model has been extended to account for natural language sentence processing effects (Johns & Jones, 2015). The current article extends this work to account for sentence production, and demonstrates that the structure of language itself provides sufficient power to generate syntactically correct sentences, even with no higher-level information about language provided to the model."
