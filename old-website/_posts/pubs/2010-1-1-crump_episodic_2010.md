abstract: "Sequential control over routine action is widely assumed to be controlled by stable, highly practiced representations. Our findings demonstrate that the processes controlling routine actions in the domain of skilled typing can be flexibly manipulated by memory processes coding recent experience with typing particular words and letters. In two experiments, we extended Masson’s (1986) procedure for measuring item-specific learning in the context of acquiring an unfamiliar skill to the highly skilled domain of typing. Skilled typists’ performance improved during practice with typing words composed from a specific set of letters. In a transfer phase, performance was fastest for trained words, followed by new words composed of trained letters, and slowest for new words composed of untrained letters. The finding that recent episodic experience with typing particular words and letters influences skilled typing performance holds widespread implications for theories of typing, sequence learning, and motor control."
